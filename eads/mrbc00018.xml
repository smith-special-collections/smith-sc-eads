         <p>Anna Hempstead Branch (1875-1937) was an American poet who editor William Thomas Stead called "the Browning of American poetry." She was a member of the 1897 Smith College graduating class. The year after her graduation her poem "The Road 'Twixt Heaven and Hell" was selected as the year's best verse by a college graduate by Century Magazine. Sonnets from a Lock Box (1929), a collection of thirty-eight first person sonnets is noted for its directness and mystical symbolism and is regarded as her best work.</p>
         <p>Branch was known for her philanthropy, particularly in support of Chrstodora House, a New York City settlement house. She created the Poet's Guild whose members, including Robert Frost and Sara Teasdale, taught classes there. Branch died of cancer in 1937 at the age of 62.</p>
