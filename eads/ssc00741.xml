         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Voices from Inside was founded in 1999 to bring "the power of the pen" to incarcerated women, primarily at the Western Massachusetts Regional Women's Correctional Center in Chicopee and, for the formerly incarcerated, in communities in Western Massachusetts. It is a volunteer organization which holds poetry workshops several times a year, has published two well-received anthologies, holds public readings throughout western Massachusetts, and generally seeks to give voice to women who are or have been within the criminal justice system through the poetry they create. More information can be found on their Web site at: http://www.voicesfrominside.org/</p>
