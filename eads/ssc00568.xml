         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>The Kansas City Womyn's Chorus was founded in 1979 by a diverse group of women for the purpose of singing non-sexist music and to "share, celebrate, and build women's culture." The chorus aimed to be open to anyone who wished to participate, and many members had no muscial training, some didn't read music. For every concert, those with real musical skill took on mentoring those who had trouble staying on pitch so that they could be a part of the chorus; many women laboriously made practice tapes of all the parts to help members with less skill learn their parts. The group performed primarily in local event. After participating in a regional festival in DeKalb, Illinois in 1995, with barely enough members attending to perform, the chorus disbanded.</p>
