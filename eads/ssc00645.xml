         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Sayre Sheldon was born in Boston, Mass. on September 28, 1926, the daughter of Ruth Wilma Schoellkopf and Philip Phillips. She graduated from Putney School in 1944, and went on to earn her B.S from Radcliffe College in 1948, and her M.A. in American Literature from Boston University in 1956. Sheldon has been a long time political and social activist. She was co-founder of Women's Action for New Directions (originally Women's Party for Survival, then Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament) with Dr. Helen Caldicott, and President Emerita of the National WAND Board. She is professor of literature at Boston University and has been involved in that university's Metropolitan College prison program. She has authored several plays and articles about women's issues and peace issues. She edited the anthology Her War Story: 20th Century Women Write About War, published in 1999 by Southern Illinois University Press. Sheldon represents WAND as an NGO at the United Nations.</p>
