         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Gertrude "Trudy" Feiss was born in Cleveland, OH on June 19, 1919 to parents Edith Lehman and Paul Louis Feiss. After graduating from Shaker Heights High School, Feiss studied Art at Smith College from 1937 to 1941. While at Smith, she created cartoons and illustrations for student publications and eventually served as the art editor of the "Tatler" literary magazine. Feiss served in the Marine Corps during World War II. There she continued to flex her artistic muscles as an illustrator for training films and the creator of the serialized comic "P.F.C. Potts," which was published in "The Quantico Sentry." After briefly teaching at Western College for Women, Feiss received a Master of Fine Arts in Painting from Cranbrook Academy of Arts, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Shortly afterward she began work in the children's book industry. Feiss was a long-time resident of Gramercy Park in New York and an active member of the Gramercy Stuyvesant Independent Democrats. She lived in New York City until her death in 2008.</p>
