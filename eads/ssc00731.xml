         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Edith Mae Shaw Racine was born in Dover, Maine, the daughter of Fred A. Shaw and Annie Harmon Shaw. At the age of 18 she married John O. Racine and both of them would work in Brown's Mill, owned by the American Woolen Company, in Dover for the next several decades as they raised their family of five children. One of those children, Doris, moved to Boston in 1929, working in various clerical positions during the Great Depression. In 1940 Doris Ravine married George McLennan and they would soon move to Braintree, just outside of Boston, where they raised their family. The frequent letters Edith wrote to her daughter Doris over almost four decades provide a glimpse into family life during the first half of the twentieth century, mother/daughter relationships, and the impact of the Great Depression on ordinary people.</p>
