                  <p>Martha A. Ackelsberg was born in New York City in 1946 and is a graduate of Radcliffe College and Princeton University (where she received her Masters and PhD). She has been a faculty member of Smith College since 1972, where she teaches government and the study of women and gender. She taught one of the first courses dealing with gender at Smith College ("Women and Social Change") and has been a member of the Committee on the Study of Women and Gender and the Five College Women's Studies Committee. Her work at Smith focuses on the construction of gender and citizenship in the realm of what she calls "applied feminist theory," and the anarchist women's organization in Spain.</p>
                  <p>In the late 1960's and early 1970's, Ackelsberg was involved in the women's health movement in New York City and student activism at Princeton during her time there as a graduate student during the years of 1968 and 1972. She has also been involved with several movements aimed at changing the status of women within the Jewish community, including the politics of changing family structures and the place of the LGBT community.</p>
                  <p>Martha Ackelsberg currently lives with her partner, Judith Plaskow, in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she is involved with various feminist, progressive, and Jewish organizations. She and her partner contribute to current "gay marriage" debates.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Martha Ackelsberg describes her work in Jewish feminist communities and her experiences with attempts to make sense of her lesbian identity in terms of her Judaism. The interview first focuses on Ackelsberg's early observations of gender inequalities within Judaism and then moves into her work within feminist organizations such as Ezrat Nashim and B'Not Esh to try to combat those injustices. Ackelsberg's describes her feelings on current gay issues such as the word "queer," gay marriage, and the troubles that come about when defining a unified LGBT or Jewish LGBT community. The interview frames Ackelsberg's relationships both with her ex-husband and with her current partner, Judith, and investigates the intricacies involved in becoming a lesbian step-parent and the multiple definitions of family that have become central to Ackelsberg's life, passions, and academic work.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Deborah Faison describes growing up in Philadelphia, PA in the early 1960s.  Although raised in a two-person household, Deborah, her siblings and her mother experienced abuse and neglect at the hands of the man that Deborah believed to be her biological father.  It wasn't until she was an adult that she learned that the man she believed to be her father was actually her stepfather and had adopted her at a young age.  Deborah recalls having lived part of her childhood with her two uncles.  She stated that they were very instrumental in her development and she spoke of them fondly.  Although Deborah married at the age of 21 and moved to Washington, DC, she soon fell in love with a woman and began a partnership with this woman that lasted for over 22 years. Her partner died unexpectedly and Deborah speaks poignantly and passionately about how her Partner Mya helped to shape Deborah's life and how it was Mya who helped Deborah gain a greater appreciation and deeper spirituality in terms of her Christian faith.  When Deborah came out to her Mother her Mother rejected her and they did not speak for over 12 years.  Eventually they reunited and maintain a loving and healthy relationship today.  Deborah's story is unique in that it chronicles the everyday life of an African American Lesbian.  Deborah became active in a Black Gay church where her perspective about homosexuality as a sin changed drastically.  Deborah has a very deep faith walk and her belief system is interspersed with prophecy and visions.  Although Deborah did not belong to any political or social LGBT organizations, she has lived the majority of her adult life as an out African American Lesbian.  Her quiet strength, deep faith and her ability to live out her convictions in her day-to-day life is a testimony of radicalism and courage.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Flachs talks growing up in Missouri and living in a single-parent home with her brother. She also goes into detail about her coming out process during her first year at the University of Michigan, where she made strong bonds with her field hockey coach, and dealt with issues of isolation and depression, culminating in a suicide attempt. Flachs then describes her struggle as a lesbian and as a physical education teacher within the public school system in both the Midwest and Massachusetts. Flachs' interview is particularly strong around the issues of sexual orientation discrimination within the workforce and her personal coming out process and difficulties. Her story tells us that homophobia is still in full force, even in the Northeast.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Andrea Hairston describes her childhood in a working-class African-American community in Pittsburgh and her experiences in community activism around Civil Rights, union organizing, and anti-war activity through her teenage years. Describing her sense of "revolving movements," she details her subsequent involvement with women's movements and queer organizing and community through her time as a student at Smith College. The interview focuses on her sense of multiple-issue activism over time, her experience of Northampton's queer, activist, and artistic community development since the '70s, her work with Chrysalis Theatre, and her relationships with her partner, Pan Welland, and James Emery in their three-person household. Hairston's stories detail how her experiences with and senses of community, collective action, and imaginative possibility have shaped both her approach to queer identity and activism in the world, making a strong contribution to these postwar histories.</p>

                  <p>Rebecca "Becky" Lukens was born in 1960 in Lake Forest, IL and raised in Park Ridge, IL.  She went to college first at Michigan State, and then transferred to the University of Oregon where she received a BS in Asian History and Education with a US History Minor before continuing on to receive an MAT from Lewis and Clark College.  </p>
                  <p>She and her partner, Lisa Dieringer, have been together for 10 years.  They married in Oregon, although their marriage is no longer recognized by the state as Oregon later amended the constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.  She never sent in the check to get the "refund" on their marriage license, so in her book that still counts.  They adopted their two sons, Sam (6) and Isaac (2) from the Pacific Islands.</p>
                  <p>During the 1980's she was politically active, and participated in marches even though sometimes she had to wear a bag over her head because the school district would have fired her.  Becky was the department head of the West Linn High School's social studies department in 1992, when the elections for Measure 9 were approaching.  She was outed by a journalist for the Oregonian, and although at times she worried for her life, she was also struck by the amount of support she received from the community around her.  In 1993, she left West Linn and founded an alternative middle and high school with four other teachers in Portland.  She is currently the co-director of the school and teaches social studies.</p>

In the last third of the interview, she talks about faith, and the formation of family.</p>

                  <p>Judith Plaskow (b. 1947) is a Jewish feminist theologian.  Her work exists at the juncture of practice and ethics, applying feminist thought to religious thought and belief.  She is among the first scholars to develop and promulgate a body of feminist scholarship in religion.</p>
                  <p>Judith was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Long Island during the 1950s.  She has one sister and was raised in the Reform Judaism tradition.  As a Jewish feminist scholar, she is the first to identify as a theologian.  She received her B.A. from Clark University in 1968 and her M.A. and Ph.D. from Yale University.  She initially taught at Wichita State University in Kansas, but left there in 1979.  Since then, she has taught at Manhattan College.  From 1969 till 1984 she was married to the Rabbinic scholar Robert Goldenberg and had one son, Alexander, born in 1977.  She came out as a lesbian in the 1980s and celebrated her commitment ceremony with Martha Ackelsberg in 1986.  </p>
                  <p>As a theologian, Judith is trained in Christian theology, although she is committed to her Jewish faith and evolved over time to do her theological work within the Jewish tradition.  Much of her works deals with the problem of theodicy, a question she has been grappling with since her teens, as well as with sexuality, and issues such as political justice for the state of Israel.  Along with her partner Martha, she is one of the co-founders of B'Not Esh, a Jewish feminist group.  Judith has served in high ranking positions for the American Academy of Religion and was one of the early chairs of its Women and Religion group.  Among her work, Judith's book, Standing Again At Sinai, is of particular importance in relation to how the body and sexuality interact with traditional language and understanding of God in the formation of the individual and their lived religious practice and understanding.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Jennifer Walters describes growing up as the oldest of six children in a Catholic working-class family and community in Buffalo, New York.  She explains how her early experiences as a student leader of college ministry at Marquette University, and later as a counselor to HIV-positive patients at Fenway Community Health Center, led her to obtain a doctorate from the Episcopal Divinity School. The interview centers on Walters' vocational discernment to the priesthood as an openly lesbian woman.  She also details her coming out process, both to herself and her family, and emphasizes her family and community's unfailing support as she negotiated a place for herself in the Catholic Church and later the Episcopal Church in the midst of homophobic harassment.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Michele Barale describes growing up in a working class family and community in Chicago and Los Angeles. Specifically, she discusses living with her mother and Dutch Presbyterian grandmother in Chicago, and her experiences as a college student, participating in lesbian separatism and working at a gay bar before attending graduate school. The interview focuses on her experiences with religion and with lesbian feminism, her experiences as a gay woman who came out to herself and met her first love in college, her path to academia, her interest in queer literature, and opinions on how the different minority groups have interacted with one another. The sound was not recorded on the second tape, but she discusses her experiences after becoming a professor, and how she considers academia a form of activism. Michele's story illustrates that, despite becoming an atheist, religion played a largely positive role in her life, how the lesbian and gay communities have evolved over time, how lesbian feminism has evolved, and influenced her path in academia.</p>

                  <p>Alix Dobkin (b. 1940) was born in New York City, and lived in Philadelphia, New York City, Washington D.C., and Kansas City, Missouri.  At 16, Dobkin returned to Philadelphia and attended Temple University, graduating from the Tyler School of Fine Arts in 1962.  Dobkin's parents were members of the Communist Party, which Dobkin herself joined at the age of 16.  Her parents and the camp Dobkin attended exposed her to the tradition of folk music at a very young age.  Dobkin began performing tradition folk and international music publically, and moved to Greenwich Village in 1962 to perform at clubs and coffee shops.  Dobkin married Sam Hood, manager of the Gaslight Cafe in 1965, and they moved to Florida to start a new club, the Gaslight South.  They returned to New York City after the club folded.  They had a daughter, Adrian in 1970, and they separated in 1971. Dobkin announced she was a lesbian in 1972 after meeting Liza Cowen.  Dobkin released the first album made by and for women, Lavender Jane Loves Women, in 1973.  Dobkin began performing for women-only audiences, and was a strong advocate for women's spaces.  She released 6 albums and played concerts in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and many other countries.  She currently sits on the steering committee for OLOC (Old Lesbians Organizing for Change), and spends as much time as she can with her three grandchildren, Lucca, Marley, and Sorella.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Deborah Earley describes the difficulties that she experienced growing up as a tomboy in her Presbyterian home in Louisville, Kentucky. Earley explains that for much of her life, she sought to find acceptance from classmates, friends, and family through "overachieving perfectionism." Earley describes her internalized suppression of feelings for women because of her religious and familial influences. After a dysfunctional marriage, a 30-year-old Earley began her coming out process. Looking back, Earley explains the importance of living her own life and making the right choices for herself. Primarily, Earley focuses on her role as a mother of two sons, Garrison and Byron, and discusses the pressures and difficulties of raising two boys in a lesbian home.</p>

                  <p>Jan Everhart (b. October 27, 1956) in Cambridge, United Kingdom. She is one of four children and spent most of her childhood in Berkley, California. Her mother was a homemaker while her father was a university professor, administrator, and President of California Institute of Technology.  Everhart earned her A.B. from U.C. Davis in 1978, her Masters of Divinity from Drew University Theological School in 1981, and her PhD from IIiff School of Theology at the University of Denver in 2003.  </p>
                  <p>After finishing seminary in 1981, Everhart's bishop appointed her as the Associate Pastor of Sunnyvale United Methodist Church, where she worked until 1984.  She then moved to Byron, California, where she worked as a Pastor of Byron Methodist Church from 1984 to 1989. After this position, she entered her final career move as a pastor within the Methodist Church as Pastor of Wesley United Methodist Church from 1989 to 1998.  At this point, Everhart left the Methodist Church because, as a lesbian, she could not live openly with her partner within the confines of the church. She then moved to Denver, Colorado where she became an adjunct professor at IIiff School of Theology while simultaneously earning her PhD. In July of 2003, she moved to Iowa, working as Director for the Initiative of Vocational Exploration at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa. She became Assistant Professor of Religion in 2006, and worked as director of the Lilly Service Initiative until 2009. Currently, she is a professor of religion at Simpson College.  </p>
                  <p>Since entering the world of academia, she has published a plethora of articles, often underscoring feminist ideals and LGBTQ issues within a biblical framework. Everhart has also written about the American birth control conflict, and has presented several papers at the Society of Biblical Annual Meetings across the country.  She has given numerous presentations, discussing her published work around the nation. She has earned numerous awards for her work in service and for her vital addition to the scholarship of religion.  </p>
                  <p>Outside of academia, Everhart's community involvement has remained consistent throughout the years.  She was convener of the Clergywomen's Association in California-Nevada in the mid-1980s.  In 1999, she participated with 70 clergy colleagues in an "ecclesiastical disobedience" by officiating at a public holy union at the Sacramento Convention Center. Subsequently, she was charged with disobedience to the order and doctrine of the United Methodist Church.  Everhart has also been active in reproductive rights and queer rights, volunteering at Rainbow Alley, a drop in center for queer youth in Denver, Colorado. Everhart met her partner, Jan Ratliff, at an AA meeting, and has been sober since 1984. Everhart and Ratliff have been partnered since 1988, celebrated a holy union in 1991, and were legally married in the state of Iowa in 2009. They have three grown children and reside on a farm in Southern Iowa. </p>

                  <p>Lori Harris (b. 1957) was born in Dayton, Ohio, and was raised primarily by her mother and her maternal grandparents. Her mother worked in her grandmother's beauty salon and later became an administrative assistant at a local high school. Harris identifies as African American and part Blackfoot and as gay/lesbian. She was raised as a Baptist, later became a Methodist, and currently has no religious affiliation, but still considers herself a spiritual person. In the 1980's and 90's, she was involved with an organization called "The Black Lesbian Support Group." </p>
                  <p>She attended a vocational high school school, and later went on to take courses in Communication at Trinity University from 2006-2007. Harris worked as a legal assistant and secretary for a law firm from 1975 to 2007, when she decided to attend Smith College as an Ada Comstock Scholar. While at Smith, Harris worked as a Junior Curator/Public Historian at the Smithsonian Institution, had an archival internship at the Black Women's Health Imperative, and was a Kahn Liberal Arts Student Fellow during the 2009-2010 academic year. During the 2010-2011 academic year, she worked as an OCIP/CDO Intern at the Sophia Smith Collection.</p>
                  <p>In 2011, Harris received her BA in American Studies, with a concentration in museum studies and archival studies.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Lori Harris describes her childhood growing up in Dayton, Ohio with her siblings and her experiences dealing with her mother's divorces and her abusive stepfather. The interview focuses on her journey as a working adult returning to college to receive her bachelor's degree in American Studies. She talks at length about her academic and scholarly work in black women and lesbian health issues, as well as her experiences in the academy as a non-traditional aged student scholar of color. Harris' story about her time in Washington, D.C. as a volunteer with the Black Lesbian Support Group also sheds light on the internal race dynamics of LGBT organizations during the 1970's and 1980's. Her story adds a new perspective on the LGBT movements that gained momentum before and during the AIDS epidemic and, in particular, the voice of the marginalized, tokenized black lesbians, that has been scarcely heard before. It also delves into Harris' personal life, and her journey in discovering herself through romantic and familial relationships.</p>

                  <p>Patricia Holland (b. 1949) was born in Syracuse, New York, but grew up 
with her family in California and Virginia, and lived in New Jersey for one year. Her father was a landscape architect for the National Park Service and on the faculty of the University of Virginia. Holland's mother stayed at home until Patricia and her siblings began to attend school, then became the assistant to the Principal for Instruction at Mclean High School, and eventually became a guide at Monticello where she worked for 25 years. Holland has a brother who is 66, and three sisters who are 58, 55, and 53.
Holland attended the Virginia Commonwealth University, where she began her long dedication to community organizing, helping to develop the Welfare Rights Organization in Richmond, Virginia. She graduated in 1971with a BA in Social Welfare. Since her first job volunteering for VISTA and organizing a public housing tenant union, Holland has committed to fighting for welfare rights and self-help housing. In 1977, she became the Coordinator for Children's Services for the Pittsfield, Massachusetts Department of Mental Health's Division of Drug Rehabilitation. In 1982, Holland became the Program Manager for Project Aim, Incentive Community Enterprises, Inc. in Springfield, Massachusetts, where she developed and managed community homes for formerly institutionalized people. In the late 1970s, she purchased a sheep farm in Massachusetts, which she lived and worked on congruently with her welfare work until the early 1990s. 
Holland attended the Center for Public Policy and Administration at the University of Massachusetts and received her Masters in Public Administration in 1987. After working in housing projects for over two decades, Holland has become passionate about building affordable sustainable housing, and helping other women to do the same. Recently, she helped found the Westfield Energy Efficiency Trades Center (WEETC), a non-profit facility for women-owned businesses to build a healthier environment and economy, of which she also serves as the Executive Director.  Holland serves on many local committees involving social welfare and sustainability.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Patricia Holland describes aspects of herself as a child that are still relevant and important to her identity today, many stemming from her experiences of being a young girl living on a farm. The interview centers on her struggle to accept and celebrate herself as a woman and a lesbian, as well as the relationships that both prevented and allowed her to do so. She discusses her dedication to anti-poverty work and self-help housing, and why self-help housing is the tangible way of making a difference, especially for women.</p>

                  <p>Annie Rachele Lanzillotto (b. 1963) was born in the Bronx, New York, to Italian-American parents. Her father, Joseph Lanzillotto, was an iceman and later an electrician, and served in World War II.  Lanzillotto's mother, Rachele Lanzillotto, graduated from Jane Addams High School in the Bronx with training in cosmetology. She became a hairdresser and manicurist after divorcing Annie's father in 1975. She is the youngest of four children (Charles, 1948; Rosemarie, 1950; John, 1952). In 1975, at the age of twelve, Annie and her mother moved to Yonkers.  
 
In 1986, Lanzillotto graduated with an Honors BA in Medical Anthropology from Brown University. While at Brown, Lanzillotto worked various service jobs. In 1985, she attended the American University of Cairo where she did her thesis work at the Egyptian Ministry of Health, where she first began to "play with gender" by sometimes dressing as a man. In 1990, she went on to get her MFA in writing from Sarah Lawrence University. At age 18, Lanzillotto was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and, due to the radiation, she was later diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer at age 35.
 
Today, Lanzillotto identifies herself as a "theatre teacher, writing instructor, song writer, performer poet, director of solo theatre, director of site specific theatre, memoirist, rock vocalist, and community organizer."  In 1993, she entered the theatre world by writing and performing Confessions of a Bronx Tomboy. Theatrical highlights include her public art installation and performance A Stickball Memoir, curated by City Lore for the 2001 Smithsonian Folk Life Festival; her play Pocketing Garlic, commissioned by Franklin Furnace in 1994; her one woman show, How To Wake Up a Marine in a Foxhole, which premiered at The Kitchen Solo Voice's Series in 1998, and her two year site-specific work entitled, a'Schapett! (the act of wiping your plate clean with the heel of the bread, and savoring the juices) at The Arthur Avenue Retail Market in the Bronx. In 2010, The Annie Lanzillotto Band came out with a rock album entitled, "Blue Pill." </p>
                  <p>Lanzillotto is currently a member of the Italian American Writers Association, the Italian American Historical Association, the Franklin Furnace Archive (which preserves and encourages avant-garde art by underrepresented communities in Brooklyn), Dixon Place, and The Kitchen. She was also a member of Act Up: Rank and File from 1986-1988, and is presently a member of the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition Executive Committee. </p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Annie Lanzillotto describes her childhood in a working class Italian American family, with focused attention on the transition that moved the narrator and her mother from the Bronx to Yonkers, New York in 1974. The interview also explores the impact of her father's domestic violence on her family. Lanzillotto also discusses gender identity and the messages she received regarding sexuality and gender while attending Catholic schools, Brown University, and the American University in Cairo. In addition, Lanzillotto describes the impact of being diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma at age 18 and Thyroid Cancer at age 35, along with her understandings of work and development of an "artist family." Lanzillotto also characterizes her participation in the Triangle Factory Fire Remembrance held on March 25, 2011.</p>

                  <p>Betty Morningstar (b. 1952) grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts.  In 1971, she graduated from Smith College with an A.B. in Psychology. She pursued her graduate studies at Smith, earning her M.S.W. in 1977 and her Ph.D. in 1989.  In addition to her extensive studies at Smith, Betty holds a M.A. from the Andover Newton Theological School. Since 1983, she has worked as a therapist in a private practice.  Her teaching experience includes the Schools for Social Work at Smith and Simmons Colleges.  Currently, she serves as the president of the Massachusetts Chapter of National Association of Social Workers (NASW), and in the past, has served as the chair of the national LGBT committee of NASW.

                  <p>In this oral history, Betty Morningstar describes her evolving relationship with her parents, including their attendance at her commitment ceremony. She explains her schooling experiences as a Jewish student at both private and public schools, and articulates how many choices in her earlier adulthood manifested from her lack of choices within the social times growing up. Her educational and ideological explorations during her studies at Smith College, as both and undergraduate and graduate student, highlight her positioning on the cusp of major political movements of the late 1960s and 1970s. Additionally, she chronicles her emerging feminist and lesbian ideologies during her personal growth of relationships and professional development.  From a realization in her early childhood to become a therapist to being the president of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, Betty has demonstrated a clear professional trajectory. The interview includes experiences as a single, lesbian woman searching for the means to create a family with children and a supportive partner. All the while, Betty fuses the clinical practice of therapy with the exploration of the religious, personal self.  Betty's story details the avenues she explored to become a lifelong learner, an active community member, and a lesbian parent and spouse.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Ellen Shumsky describes growing up in a Jewish community in Brooklyn and her experiences learning about photography in France in the 1960s. The interview focuses on her experiences in the New York City school system, her experiences working in the Gay Liberation Front and co-founding the Radicalesbians, her work as a photographer and chronicler of the gay liberation movement, and her work as a social worker and psychotherapist.

                  <p>Laura Sullivan (a.k.a. "M.L.") (b. August 1, 1959) grew up in Westport, CT. The third of five children from a middle-class Italian-American family, she was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended Catholic schools throughout her primary and secondary school education, until she attended Yale University in the late 1970s. After graduation, she became a physical therapist at Yale New Haven Hospital, where she worked for eighteen years, during which time she married and had a daughter. In the early 1990s, after becoming disillusioned with her role as a physical therapist, she and her business partner, Samantha, opened the Chateau, the first women-owned and operated BDSM club in Connecticut. A strong advocate for BDSM awareness, the Chateau was a safe space for employees and patrons to find community and "play." M.L. left the Chateau in the mid-1990s over creative differences wither her business partner, and divorced her husband in the early 1990s, suffering through a tumultuous child custody battle, where her BDSM interests and activities were major factors in the court proceedings. She now lives with her daughter and leather family in Connecticut, where they run a small, private BDSM club.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>In this oral history, Laura Sullivan begins by describing her childhood in a close-knit Italian-American family, where the listener gains insight into her privileged upbringing. Her loving and supportive family provided a disciplined and structured foundation, where she had strong female role models (i.e. a mother who was a nurse and a grandmother who owned a bakery), which helped lead her to a life filled with self-determination and confidence.	</p>
                  <p>The interview mainly focuses on Laura Sullivan's interest, entrance, and existence within the BDSM community, beginning with her involvement in "shoe-licking" shenanigans in the second grade, to opening the Chateau, a mass BDSM club, to her commitment to her present, private BDSM club in Connecticut. Through her personal reflections, the audience is allowed access to the emotional and literal negotiations between the roles of wife, mother, daughter, teacher, student, etc., through a perceived sexualized lens. Her story offers valuable information on the study of alternative sexualities and women entrepreneurs in the sex industry, as well as providing a normalized perspective of what is often considered a taboo subject.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Mare Chapman describes growing up as a tomboyish child in her educated, emotion-hiding "fine family" as well as her Michigan country high school. The interview follows her feminist awakening, growth and motivation parallel to her career and to her progression through high school dating, marriage to a man, introductory lesbian dalliances, and long-term lesbian partnerships. Chapman's story depicts her experience as a mother and wife in "traditional" heterosexual marriage and it's lack of cohesion, equality, and fulfillment before her personal awakening and transition into a woman-centered life. Chapman expresses the joy and fulfillment she has found through other women, family, her career, and meditation practice.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Janet Lathrop describes growing up in Wisconsin in a small, upwardly mobile family, and her journey through college and beyond. This interview traces the development of Lathrop's early sexual and romantic attraction to women over men, and her struggle within a family that often felt constricting and even fearful of her preferences. Lathrop describes her high school and college years, including her involvement in anti-war activism on campus in Madison, Wisconsin. Never quite identifying with the word "lesbian" or the other lesbians she met, Lathrop talks about her decision to marry a man and about becoming increasingly unhappy in her marriage as the years went on. The interview also touches on Lathrop's development as a writer, and her involvement in a number of newspapers and other publications. Lathrop speaks to the experience of coming out late in life, of parenting as a lesbian, and especially to the discovery of a supportive and welcoming lesbian community and its importance in her life.</p>

                  <p>Eileen Myles (b. 1949) grew up in Arlington, Massachusetts, attended Catholic school, and graduated from the University of Massachusetts- Boston, with a BA in English.

In 1991, Myles ran for President of the United States of America, leading the first all-female write-in campaign.  She served as a Professor Emeritus at the University of California at San Diego from 2002-2007.  Myles currently lives in New York with her partner of three years, Leopoldine.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Eileen Myles describes the complexities of existing as a queer, working class individual.  She details her childhood spent in the suburbs of Boston attending Catholic schools and reflects on the presence of Nuns in her early life.  The interview, however, focuses more specifically on the later years of her life, following her move to New York City in 1974 with aspirations of becoming a poet.  Myles details her experiences in the poetry scene of the lower east side, specifically her time at Saint Mark's Church, and speaks of her coming out process as being inherently tied to the poetry community.  Myles speaks heavily about the activist sentiment present in her work, as she feels her work relates to the larger political spheres of feminism and queer politics.  Myles' story brings awareness to the intersectional aspects of identity (in this case, sexuality and class).  Additionally, she sheds light on the way in which activism at a communal level can be isolating, while simultaneously remaining imperative at a personal level.  Myles traces this thought through her relationship with second wave feminism and the political environment of the 90s.  This oral history provides excellent insight into personal, queer interaction with the larger political and cultural spheres from the 1970s-present day.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Roberta Pato describes growing up Jewish in a multi-cultural apartment building in New York City, her early consciousness of lesbian desire and the pressure towards conformity. Pato contrasts the differences between her experiences with men and women, and the process of finding relationships.  She details the painful experience of losing the love she found with a woman to societal expectations. Pato discusses the experience of being married to a man for nine years, and the affair and a thirty four year partnership with an abusive woman. The interview focuses on the process of losing family due to this relationship, and reconnecting to them, the reality and consequences of an abusive partnership, the arduous process of leaving an abuser, the finding of a lesbian community and searching for love and company in more recent years. Pato emphasizes the importance of safety and truthfulness, and the toll taken from being at least partially closeted for almost thirty four years.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Becky Shaw describes her childhood in a conservative, working-class family in Towanda, PA.  The interview focuses on her journey to self-discovery, discussing her struggles with coming out to herself, as well as her family and friends, as well as accepting her ambitions outside of traditional female roles. This period ranges from her formative high school years to well into adulthood, as she began her career in student affairs. Shaw shares her complicated relationship with her family, history of past relationships gone wrong, and discrimination she's suffered as a lesbian and mother. Shaw goes in depth about the process of having children, and creating a family with her partner, Amanda Costin. Shaw's narrative details the way in which we come to understand the shift in lesbian history through the 80s and 90s, as she moves past a feminist movement to a more current period, in which she sought her own personal happiness.</p>

                  <p>Karla Kavanaugh (b.1950, New York City) grew up on a small family farm outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the oldest of three children in a politically active family. Her parents came from vastly different backgrounds. Her mother, Carola, who received masters in journalism at Columbia University, was the daughter of a well-known art curator and an independent early feminist. Her father, Ted, who worked in public relations, grew up in a working class Irish-Catholic family in New York City's Irish Harlem. The family grew their own food and were liberal activists in a small, conservative rural town. Kavanaugh graduated from Colby College where she was once again considered politically radical by the conservative community of students. Her college years coincided with the social movements of the 1960's and she participated in local and national protests including those around the Women's Movement, Civil Rights, against the Vietnam War and joined her family in their efforts to block construction of a nuclear power plant near her childhood home. She learned weaving at summer camp and after college found her way to Peter's Valley, an artists' community in upstate New York, where she was employed for several years, including a period as interim co-director. It was there that she learned carpentry. She moved with two carpenters from Peter's Valley to the Chatham, New York area where they spent several years constructing a unique artisan house. Through this experience she honed her skills, and became acquainted with local lumber yards and other tradespeople. In the early1980s she co-founded Octagon Construction, an all-women construction company. An advocate of green-building practices and affordable housing, Kavanaugh is presently also construction manager for Habitat Inc. of Columbia County, New York, where she is oversaw the recent construction of the first Habitat passive house in the country. Kavanaugh came out as a lesbian in her late 30s and became active in lesbian and gay causes. She is a founding board member of the Berkshires Stonewall Community Coalition and has served in various capacities in numerous other organizations.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Karla Kavanaugh describes her childhood as one of three children growing up on a small family farm outside Philadelphia. She reflects on the experience of being part of a politically radical, activist family in a conservative, rural town, as well as her experiences as an activist during the 1960s to the present. The interview focuses on her career as a carpenter in the primarily male building trades, including her founding of an all-women's construction company in Columbia County, New York in the early 1980s. She discusses the formation of Octagon Construction as a political act, as she and her business partners sought to claim a position of power in order to circumvent the difficulties experienced by other women who were trying to break into all-male building trades at the time. Kavanaugh discusses their vision of creating a site where women who wanted to explore careers in the trades could come and learn their craft in a supportive environment. Kavanaugh, who came out in her late 30s, talks about her experiences in the active lesbian community in the rural Berkshire Mountains community from the 1980s to the present. She talks about her present work as a builder, which is divided between Octagon and her position managing the builds for Habitat, Inc. of Columbia County, where she has just completed construction the first Habitat passive house in the country, particularly her commitment to green building as a strategy to mitigate the destructive trend of climate change, which she says is "the frontier now" and the center of her current activism. </p>
                  <p>The interviewer and narrator have a close personal relationship. They met while Amanna was a student in the Women's Carpentry class Kavanaugh teaches at The Heartwood School in Washington, Massachusetts.</p>

                  <p>David Perez (b.1961) grew up in Northampton, Massachusetts and attended Northampton High School. He has two older brothers and a younger sister. Both of his parents emigrated to the United Stated from Puerto Rico in the 1950s. Perez  married his wife Michelle in 1985 and their son Derek was born in 1986. His mother, father, brother, brother-in-law, sister-in-law and David  have all worked for Smith College. At the time of this interview, Perez had just completed his 30th year of service as a custodian at Smith. He was the assistant coach for the Smith basketball team from 2000-2007. Perez and his wife share a two-family home with his brother and sister-in-law in Florence, Massachusetts.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Perez talks about how his family came to the United States and, specifically, to Northampton. He talks briefly about his parents and their work on tobacco fields in Sunderland, Massachusetts. The interview focuses on the changing face of Northampton, particularly on shifting class dynamics and other shifts since the 1980s. Perez speaks about the lessening of homophobia he has observed in Northampton, and his own growing awareness of the lesbian community at Smith, as well as his recent identification with pan-sexuality and the misreading of his gender. He also speaks about his experiences as the assistant coach of the basketball team at Smith, his operatic voice lessons, AIDS, racism in Northampton High and his mentorship of a transboy through Facebook. The oral history traces Perez's work history from employment in a car showroom to the Daily Hampshire Gazette and then to Smith College.</p>

                  <p>Dana Beyer (b. 1952) grew up in New York City and graduated from Cornell University Phi Beta Kappa in 1974 and from University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1978. Beyer worked as a physician and eye surgeon in Kenya, Washington, D.C., Florida, Nepal, and Mississippi.  She retired from clinical practice in 1990 and has been living in Chevy Chase, Maryland, devoting her time to her two sons, earning a master's degree in organic chemistry, and participating in extensive political activism. Beyer ran for Maryland state senate in 2006 and 2010 while serving as a Montgomery County Council staffer, and is currently (in 2014) campaigning again. If elected, she would be the first transgender state delegate in the United States, and one of very few openly transgender elected officials in the world. Beyer has been a leader in many local and national organizations, including Gender Rights Maryland, the Democratic National Convention Rules Committee, Teachthefacts.org, Equality Maryland, Progressive Neighbors, Human Rights Campaign, and National Center for Transgender Equality. Her activism includes bringing comprehensive sex education to Montgomery County public schools, working to pass an artificial trans fats ban in Montgomery County as a County Council staffer, lobbying to pass gender identity anti-discrimination laws in three Maryland counties, and helping to re-write the DSM in 2012 so that being transgender is no longer considered a mental illness. Beyer also reaches a wider audience through writing a weekly column for the Huffington Post.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Dana Beyer describes her childhood in a Jewish family in New York City in the 1950s and her intense focus on her education. The interview largely traces Beyer's life through her gender identity and how being closeted for so long impacted her life in many ways, from her relationships with her parents, two ex-wives, and two sons, to her choice of medical specialty, to her introverted yet risk-taking personality. Beyer's story moves through realizing she was a girl as a young child in the late 1950s, experiencing trauma and medical mistreatment from an intersex complication as a teenager in the 1960s, witnessing the 1969 Stonewall Rebellion from the closet, traveling the world for her medical career in the late 1970s/early 1980s, learning about successful trans women like Lynn Conway and the possibilities of surgeries in the 1980s, beginning the transition process in the 1990s, and fully coming out as Dana in the early 2000s, after the catalyst of the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Beyer reflects on transphobia and assimilation in the queer community, the rewards and challenges of activism, shifts in sexual orientation labels, and differences and parallels between the Boomer and Millennial generations. Her story shows how she used her experiences of trauma and compartmentalization to fuel her surgical and activist careers.</p>

                  <p>Penny Coleman (b. 1948) grew up on Long Island, graduated from Vassar in 1970, and received a Bachelor's of Photographic Arts from Brooks Institute of Photography in 1974 and a Master's in Social Policy from Empire State SUNY in 1996. Coleman's career as a photographer spans employment at various newspapers including the New York Times, the LA Times and the Dallas Morning News. She is the author of two books, Village Elders and Flashback: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Suicide, and the Lessons of War. In addition to the publication of her second book, Coleman has written numerous articles on veterans' issues and spoke before the House of Representatives Veterans Affairs Committee on the topic of suicide among veterans. She is currently the program director of the Graduate Certificate Program in Veteran Services at Empire State.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Penny Coleman describes her childhood on Long Island, including the experience of being the child of liberals in a very racist and segregated community and her growing awareness of social injustices which would shape the work she has done throughout her life. This interview focuses on the parts of Coleman's life that have led her to write her two books, both of which work towards elevating the voices of marginal communities. Her marriages, first to a Vietnam veteran who took his own life, and the current one to a professor at Empire State, have been central to the work she does as a political activist. Her activism draws on her skills as a photographer and journalist as well as her position as a member of the LGBTQ community and the military community. Coleman's recollections of the oral history work she did in order to write Village Elders and again to write Flashback reflect on the importance of oral history practices and how she has used them in her efforts to fight injustice.</p>

                  <p>Geri (Geraldine) DiNardo (b. 1943) graduated high school from St. Mary's in Milford, MA and moved on to graduate from Our Lady of the Elms in Chicopee, MA, in 1964. She received a Masters in Education from Worcester State College and went on to teach in Spencer and Worcester public schools. She was involved with Catholic Charities, and for fifteen years, she worked for the Division of Mental Health. Geri has been associated with the Catholic Worker Movement and the Worcester Mustard Seed since their beginning.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Geri discusses issues of growing up as a lesbian in a heterosexual world. Due to her lack of awareness of lesbianism, she only first identified as a lesbian at the age of 70. Geri has had relationships with women throughout her adult life, and speaks about the intersection of her sexuality with her staunch Catholic faith. She talks about her growing frustration with intolerant Church doctrine, which caused her to speak out at age 70, writing in to a local Catholic Worker newsletter and identifying herself as a lesbian. Geri has since been involved in her local PFLAG. She strongly urges that LGBT Catholics should not leave the Church and discusses her involvement in the Worcester Mustard Seed.</p>

                  <p>L. Orrell (b. 1962) grew up in Ellicott City, Maryland and various parts of New Mexico. As a young adult, Orrell lived in Dallas, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; and Lynn, Massachusetts. During this time she worked various jobs and participated in local lesbian and gay social scenes. Orrell moved to Weston, Massachusetts to care for her aging grandmother in 1984. Through their relationship and the location of Weston, she began to pursue a growing interest in horticulture, eventually resulting in her engagement in higher education and completion of a B.S.  and M.S. in environmental biology. She pursued advanced degrees in environmental biology, completing a Ph.D. program in 2006. Throughout this time, Orrell ran her own landscaping business, taught as a grad student, married, divorced her partner/wife of 20 years, farmed the land, and raised two children.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history L. Orrell describes her childhood in a middle class neighborhood in Ellicott City, Maryland in the 1960s. Orrell then describes her experiences moving to small-town New Mexico as a young teenager, her experiences at the Cambridge School of Weston in the 1970s, and her subsequent move back to New Mexico after being pulled out of school. Situating her teenage years in the 1970s, Orrell discusses her developing lesbian sexuality, her attraction to women, and her engagement with "sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll" during this time.  The second half of the interview is focused on her life as a young adult. Orrell moved to multiple states with different lovers, eventually settling in Weston, MA to care for her aging grandmother. The focus of this part of the interview is on her developing passion for horticulture, which led her to begin college and pursue degrees in environmental biology. In this period of her life, Orrell met and married her partner/wife with whom she raised two children. Orrell reflects on her marriage and divorce extensively in the final forty minutes of the interview, discussing internalized homophobia and difficulties of lesbian parenting as issues that emerged during the relationship. Orrell ends with a small discussion of her current partner, who was her best friend before they were romantically involved.</p>

                  <p>Vicki Gabriner (b. 1942) was born in Brooklyn, New York, where both of her parents were foreign language teachers in public schools. She attended Cornell University and moved on to the University of Wisconsin, at which point she spent her summers doing voter registration work in Atlanta. After receiving a master's degree in education in 1978 she moved to Atlanta, where she founded the Atlanta Lesbian Feminist Alliance, one of the longest-lasting lesbian feminist groups in the United States. Vicki then left Atlanta and has since spent over twenty years in Massachusetts. She has been legally married to her current partner since 2004. In 2009, Vicki received her Ph.D. in women's history from Union Institute, documenting her mother's involvement in Parent Teacher Association activism. Vicki has been published by Sojourner Truth Press and in Quest: A Feminist Quarterly, among other publications.</p>

                  <p>This oral history has two components.  Vicki first chronicles her life and experiences from childhood to coming out in Atlanta, Georgia. It is organized by both time and place, as Vicki describes what led her from Cornell, to Madison, to Atlanta, and finally to Massachusetts. She illustrates how her exposure to activism early in life informed and influenced her later participation in the labor rights movement and gay liberation. The second half of the oral history is topic-based. Vicki draws upon her experience with lesbian feminism to inform her opinions on the current LGBT marriage equality movement, parenthood, religion, and the aging gay and lesbian community.</p>

                  <p>Carolyn Innes (b. 1937) grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After graduating high school she received a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Penn State in 1970, and obtained a Master's Degree in 1972. A self-described "activist by association," she and a lover moved to San Francisco in 1957 and worked as volunteers at The Ladder offices, stapling pages and mailing copies in non-descript packaging. In 1972, Innes organized the first gay pride parade in Philadelphia alongside Barbara Gittings and Kay Tobin.
    At Gittings' urging she founded the Gay Nurses Alliance (GNA) in Pennsylvania in 1973. The GNA emerged nationally after she and co-founder David Waldron presented the organization at the American Nurses Association convention in June 1974 in San Francisco. Innes' goal was to raise awareness about the number of gay nurses, provide a forum, work for the civil rights of gay nurses, and fight for the medical rights of gay patients. The AIDS epidemic played a pivotal role in lesbian nurses' coming out process. Innes continued her activism, organizing the first gay pride parade in San Diego, and as Director of the Gay Center in San Francisco. She moved to the east coast in 1984 to focus on a career in hospice care. She currently resides in Hadley, Massachusetts with her cat, Jeter.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Carolyn Innes describes her childhood in Philadelphia, her experience as a nursing student in the 1950s, and her accidental introduction to gay rights activism after college. The interview chronicles her life over a sixty-year period, through personal experiences, friendships and romantic relationships, and consequential activist work during the gay rights movement. 
Her close associations with prominent lesbian activists during the formation of the Philadelphia Gay Pride Parade led her to form the Gay Nurses Alliance with friend and fellow nurse, David Waldron. She also addresses her alcoholism, subsequent sobriety and her various career choices in the field of nursing.</p>

She married a man and lived with him outside of Newark for a few years. At around age 29, she came out to her husband and her family as gay. She divorced her husband and her very conservative Christian parents disowned her. While working at a clinic, she met a woman named who also worked there as a social worker. They began to date and eventually became partners. They have lived in Pickerington, Ohio, for many years with their various pets. Jenkins has never had any children. Professionally, she has worked as a psychiatrist for her entire career, working both in private practice and at hospitals and clinics.

                  <p>Miriam Kaufman (b. 1954) grew up in Cleveland, OH, Durham, NC, and Kingston, ON. Her family moved around during her childhood due to her father's job, and she is one of five children. Kaufman dropped out of high school, but later returned to school, first earning a BSN from Duke University and then an MD from Queen's University. Kaufman is an eminent pediatrician, currently serving as the Division Head of Adolescent Medicine at SickKids Hospital in Toronto, where she has worked for the past 20+ years. Kaufman and her partner, Roberta Benson, successfully petitioned Ontario for second-parent adoption rights for their two children in the early nineties, enabling them to both be recognized as their legal parents of their children. Prior to this, Kaufman was also involved in anti-war and LGBT organizing, notably in Durham, NC and with the Queen's Homophile Association in Kingston, ON.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Miriam Kaufman describes her childhood in Cleveland, Durham, and Kingston as one of five children of a pathologist father and a stay-at-home mother. She dropped out of high school in Kingston, moving back to Durham, where she became heavily involved in anti-war activism. She then went on to pursue nursing and medical school, meeting her partner at the Queen's Homophile Association when she was in medical school at Queen's University. The interview then shifts to Kaufman and her partner's experience successfully petitioning Ontario for second-parent adoption rights for their two children in the early nineties, enabling them to both be recognized as the legal parents of their children. Kaufman recounts the court experience and then reflects on parenting and partner relationships, both in general and within the LGBT community. Kaufman ends the interview with reflections on how the movement for LGBT rights has changed since she first became involved and the state of politics and government in Canada and the United States.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Litchford describes growing up with her brother and cousins in Fort Smith, AK. She describes how her grandmother, who raised her, had no money, but Litchford felt a lot of love in their home. Marge knew she was interested in women from an early age, but also knew that it would not be accepted, and developed the strategy of having boyfriends in high school and in the army so that she would not be suspected. A church funded Marge's first year at Ozark Christian College, which is where she had her first relationship with a woman.  After she left school she joined the Army, worked in group homes, was a military police officer, and worked as a parole officer. Throughout her oral history, Marge discusses how she made family through her friends and her relationships. She also discusses how she was drawn to fields in which she could help people, specifically through counseling.</p>

                  <p>Liz Margolies (b. 1953) was born in New York City and grew up in New Rochelle, NY. Her parents divorced when she was fourteen years old and her father remarried twice. She graduated with a B.A. in psychology from Clark University in 1975. While in college she found radical feminism and began to join consciousness-raising circles and helped to start the second rape crisis center in the country. She had many varied relationships but eventually came out as a lesbian during her first semester of social work school. In 1977 she received her Master's of Social Work from Rutgers. Margolies then began to work as a psychotherapist in New York City specializing in trauma, grief, sexuality, illness, and human/animal bonding. In 1992, Margolies gave birth to her first and only child. Beginning in the early 2000s, Margolies became involved in gay and lesbian cancer-related health activism and in 2006 founded the National LGBT Cancer Network. In 2012, Margolies' private life became public when her long term partner proposed at the White House. Long against marriage, Margolies agreed and the two were wed in a highly publicized ceremony. Margolies currently lives in New York City with her son and several pets, working from home for the LGBT Cancer Network as well as continuing her private practice.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Margolies explores deeply her relationship with her son, partner, and larger family as well as giving insight into her motives as an activist, feminist, and lesbian. Margolies discusses what radical feminism was like in the 1970s as well as how it influenced her life and career. She has much to say on parenting as a single lesbian as well as on different kinds of queer family structures in which she has taken part. As a psychotherapist, her work has taken her down many paths, from rape to 9/11, many of which she explores in the interview.</p>

                  <p>Leslie McKenzie (b. 1946) grew up in New Jersey. She graduated from Smith College in 1968 and moved to New York City, where she obtained an MBA and an MPA. She worked in research administration at Rockefeller University and healthcare administration at Cornell University Medical College, as well as teaching business courses and working in court administration for the New York state court system. She met her current wife in 1993. They married in 2003 in Toronto. McKenzie is now retired and lives with her wife in New York City.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>In this oral history, McKenzie discusses the difficulties of growing up with a mentally ill mother and an abusive grandfather and the ways in which this experience affected her later in life. She talks about enjoying her time at Smith, including Park House, her academic life, and her relationship with her boyfriend. She moves on to a description of her work life after college in New York City. The latter half of the interview focuses on McKenzie meeting her current wife and coming to fall in love with her, despite identifying as straight up to that point. McKenzie's narrative shows both the advantages and difficulties of coming to a non-straight identity later in life, as well as discovering feminism through this experience. It also demonstrates the alienation that McKenzie felt from the lesbian community. She brings up the theme of a desire for safety in her life, and the safety that she has found in her relationship with her wife. Finally, the interview concludes with a discussion of her fraught relationship with her father in the years before his death and the reasons why she's now happier than ever before. This story brings to light the experiences of a woman who only experienced opposite-sex attractions for much of her life and was never involved in activism of any kind.</p>

                  <p>Savanna Ouellette, born Patricia Ouellette, was born on July 4, 1945 in St. Francis, Maine. Her first language is French, and she did not begin speaking English until she started school. At age ten she moved to Massachusetts and then settled in Connecticut with her parents and brother. She comes from a poor, working-class family who could not support her educational pursuits, so she put herself through college. Feminism is a big part of Ouellette's life. After college she became very active in the New Haven feminist movement, joining a band called the New Haven Women's Liberation Rock Band, an agitprop feminist rock band started by a lesbian couple. It was in this band that Ouellette met her first long-term partner. After living in New Haven, MA, Ouellette moved to the Boston area to pursue a law degree. While living in Cambridge, MA, Ouellette joined another feminist music group called The New Harmony Sisterhood Band. It was there that she met her current long-term partner and wife. Eventually Ouellette and her partner moved to western Massachusetts, settling in Shutesbury, where they adopted two girls, ages six and seven. She is currently retired and the bassist for the band One Journey.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Ouellette chronicles her life, starting with her childhood in Maine. She reflects on her social standing as part of a poor, working-class family and the effects of class on her and her life. She also discusses how her family dynamics, such as having alcoholic parents, affected her and her brother growing up. Ouellette also recounts her experiences putting herself through college, becoming a teacher, and joining the feminist movement in New Haven, Connecticut. She reconnects her experiences as a feminist musician with her relationship to class, speaking both to her own experiences and to broader feminist ideology. She tells of her journey from a rock musician to a country western musician, while also recounting her experiences within different bands. Ouellette also speaks about her romantic history and her subsequent marriage to her long-term partner. Finally, she tells of her experiences raising two adopted daughters, the struggles they had, and how she is now raising her grandson.</p>

                  <p>Deliah Rosel was born on April 14, 1950 in Queens, New York to a lower-middle-class family. She grew up with her two sisters and their parents in Queens. Her maternal grandparents and paternal family (including grandparents, uncles, and their families) were integral members of her close family growing up. She babysat and worked as a summer camp counselor and office clerk as a preteen and teenager.</p>
                  <p>Rosel identified as heterosexual and was in a ten-year relationship with a man until age 25, when she began to identify as a lesbian. She had her first long-term relationship with a woman soon after that and continued to maintain significant relationships exclusively with women from then on.</p>
                  <p>Rosel earned her bachelor's degree in biology from SUNY Stony Brook and her Master's in Public Health Medical Microbiology at UMass Amherst in 1976, which she followed with a two-year healing apprenticeship. She then worked to become certified in therapeutic massage and bodywork and started her private practice full-time in 1986.</p>
                  <p>Rosel is currently a massage therapist healer. At the moment she lives in Conway, MA and maintains a private healing practice in downtown Northampton. She has studied energy medicine and Qigong, an ancient Chinese form of movement and energy therapy, which became one of her primary foci in the mid-1990s. She had her Bat Mitzvah as an adult, and her studies inspired her to create her own version of Qigong intertwined with Judaism: L'Chaim Qigong. She wrote her dissertation on this Jewish perspective of Qigong healing and in 2008 received her doctorate in Ministry in Jewish Spiritual Direction. Rosel was raised culturally Jewish and identified as such until after she came out, when she embraced witchcraft and lesbianism and later became an observant Jewish lesbian witch. Her faith is an integral part of her life as a healer, and she frequently gives workshops and prayer services to strengthen the connection between Judaism and healing.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Rosel describes her time growing up in Queens, New York, and becoming aware of her lesbianism in the 1970s. She talks about her relationships with her two wives, how she reclaimed her Jewish heritage, and how she began her spiritual healing practice in the 1980s. At this point in her life she can reflect back on many interesting points over her lifetime, and she is enjoying getting older and gaining wisdom.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Lis Brook begins by describing her childhood, family, and early coming-out experience in New Jersey. The interview includes her activism in the antiwar movement, and more substantially, her work in the women's movement since the early 1970s. She describes harassment and corrective rape against lesbians in Northampton and the way that her community resisted these acts of violence. Brook's story details her efforts to create lesbian only space as well as the ways in which her attempts were challenged, and sometimes derailed. Lis describes her experience with butch/femme dynamics, the development of her women's only restaurant, and her future visions for new lesbian communities. The interview concludes with Brooks' reflections on her work as a therapist, her personal spirituality, and relationship with family during her adult life.</p>

                  <p>Dawn Faucher (b. 1965) grew up in Hartford, Connecticut and graduated from Mt. Holyoke College with a major in Psychology and a minor in Spanish in May 1987. At age twenty-nine, Faucher became President of the Berkshire County Chapter of the Junior League, and the youngest President of a Chapter of the Junior League in the history of the Junior Leagues. After losing custody of her two children to her abusive husband, Faucher participated in a project called the Battered Mother's Testimony Project, in which she testified about her experience of domestic violence and her custody battle before the State House. Faucher subsequently became involved in an anti-violence organization called Safe Passage that had formed the Battered Mother's Testimony Project. She served as a board member of Safe Passage for about five and a half years. Faucher is currently happily married to her spouse Andrea Martelli, and has reunited with her children. She is a supporter of President Obama and Senator Warren, and one of her greatest political passions is the movement for gay marriage.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Anne Foss describes her childhood in the 1950s and her connection with her parents. She describes noticeable differences between now and then, such as willingness to obey parents. She addresses her own struggles with being a parent contrasted with her fairly smooth transition into having same-sex relationships. She repeats frequently that she "just lives her life" and doesn't worry too much about labels, what other people are saying, or why she chose to be involved with women after her marriage broke up.  Foss believes who you love or have relationships with is less important than being a good, kind person.</p>

                  <p>Anne Foss (b.1945) grew up in Chappaqua, New York and was raised as an only child after her two older brothers moved out when she was seven. Her family was upper-middle class and was involved in the textile industry. She was very athletic growing up but there were no athletic opportunities at Connecticut College, where she completed her undergraduate degree. She went on to Harvard for a master's program and found jobs easy to come by. 
Foss married Peter Feig and had her two children with him: Jenny and Michael Foss-Feig. When she divorced him she became involved with a woman, this was the first serious same-sex relationship of her life. Foss met Bobbie Emery a year after separating from the first woman and has been with Emery ever since. They have been married since 2013 and together they run East-West Builders and maintain a farm at Hillstead Museum in Farmington, Connecticut.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Barbara Herbert describes the many experiences in her life and the way in which they shaped her into who she is today. As a prominent figure in the medical field, Barbara is very involved in the medical community in and around Boston. Her interest in public health and medicine emerged from the rage she felt in regard to the way in which women were being treated at the time. Barbara was a fervent activist and was involved in many of the big movements in LGBT history, although she makes it clear that she was not a "professional lesbian", and that her activism was very much rooted in a personal and simplistic way of living. She talks about the efforts she and her friends and partners made towards liberation, and towards changing the world in which they lived. Now an expert in emergency medicine and a well-known activist, mother, and intellectual, Barbara lives in Cambridge, MA with her partner Jean.</p>

                  <p>Barbara Herbert was born in Baltimore, MD in 1948. Throughout her life, she lived in South Carolina, New York City, and Boston, where she now lives with her partner Jean McGuire, who she met in 1990 and married in 2004. Before meeting Jean, Barbara was in a one-year heterosexual marriage with Robert Herbert in 1968. She had many girlfriends after that, and a great love, Margot, who passed away in 1974. Besides Jean, Barbara's family includes her three children Elena Polikoff (31), Daniel McGuire (34) and Megan McGuire (36). 
Barbara attended Wellesley College on a fellowship, and then Stonybrook University of New York for graduate school, from where she received her MD. She now specializes in Addiction and Emergency Medicine, and is the Medical Director at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton, MA. She is affiliated with the American Public Health Association and the Massachusetts Medical Society, and is involved with many political and professional organizations. Her medical expertise has influenced her activist and political work in the field of human rights, global health and AIDS. Barbara is also an avid activist in the field of anti-poverty, gay liberation, anti-violence, anti-racist and disability rights.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Anne Moore examines her life through the lens of her sexuality. Beginning with her childhood, she describes her time on her family's farm and her first experiences confronting sexuality and gender. She then discusses her time in college, her introduction to librarianship, and her involvement within intersecting lesbian and sports communities. Moore goes on to discuss her move to the United States, where she advanced her career, participated in feminist and LGBT activism, and encountered the difficulties of being out in the Midwest. The latter half of the interview focuses on her activism as the chair of the American Library Association's GLBT Round Table, her work documenting the lives of early female faculty members at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the importance of preserving of gay and lesbian history. She also discusses her experiences surrounding the 2013 Supreme Court repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, her thoughts on married life, and how they affect her immigrant status.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, seventy-two-year-old poet Mary Clare Powell reflects on her self-proclaimed identity as an atypical woman. Powell describes her upbringing, focusing in particular on the role of community in her hometown of Greenbelt, Maryland, and the role of the community's liberal Protestant church during her youth. She discusses how women throughout her life have helped her in realizing her full potential. Powell talks about coming to terms with her lesbian identity, and how various relationships helped her in doing so. She talks about the traveling she has done throughout her life. She considers the conscious practice of family building, what shaped the way she built her family, and the lessons she has learned in the process of building a non-traditional family. She also discusses her current relationship with religion, as well as her identity as a Christian person practicing Buddhism. The oral history ends with a reading of her poem "Old Love" from her first published book of poetry Things Owls Ate (2001 Amherst Writers and Artists Press). Powell's reflections on her story detail a richly complex and multi-faceted life.</p>

                  <p>Mary Clare Powell (b. 1942) is a lesbian-identified retired adjunct professor at Lesley University and a poet currently residing in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Powell was born in Washington, D.C. on March 28, 1942. She was raised in a cooperative community located in Greenbelt, Maryland. She is the only female child in her family, and the eldest of three children. The liberal Protestant church in the Greenbelt community was of great importance to Powell during her formative years. Religion continued to play an important role in Powell's life throughout her adolescences and adulthood. Powell's desire to be an educator from a young age drove her to earn her B.S. in Education and English from Towson State College (now Towson University), her M.L.A. in the History of Ideas from Johns Hopkins University, and her Ed.D in Creativity and Education from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Powell has taught English, poetry, and photography inside and outside of the formal classroom setting. Powell is particularly interested in poetry and photography, and these interests (combined with her role as an educator) have allowed her to travel extensively. Powell participated in various activist movements, the anti-Vietnam war movement, the Civil Rights movement, and the feminist and gay and lesbian movements. She has lived in western Massachusetts since 1984. Around this time, Powell met her spouse, Violet Walker, and Walker's two daughters. Since then, Powell's family has grown to include two grandchildren, a godson, and her brother's children and grandchildren. She currently writes poetry and gives regular readings of her poetry with musical accompaniment from her partner. She meets with fellow writers and helps them during the editing and publishing processes. She also practices Buddhism, and leads group meditation practices and Centering Prayer Buddhist sangha weekly.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Rita Schiano describes her childhood in a close-knit Italian American community in Syracuse, New York, and her difficult experience in secondary school. The interview follows her life through her engagement to a man late in high school and an introduction to the women's liberation movement in her first year of her undergraduate studies, leading Schiano to come out as gay. During the same time, she helped found consciousness raising groups around women's rights and a gay student organization on the Wells College campus. Schiano also describes, in depth, writing her second novel, Painting the Invisible Man, about her father's murder, and the emotional healing process she underwent as a result. Finally, the interview details Schiano's reflections on community, through her grassroots work with the "Tuesday Morning" Project, as well as her experiences in owning a local restaurant.</p>

                  <p>JM Sorrell (b. 1960) was born in Pittsburgh, PA, and has spent her childhood living with her adoptive parents and brother in Michigan, New Jersey, upstate New York, Jacksonville, Florida, and Northern Kentucky. Sorrell received a BA in English from the University of Kentucky in Lexington, KY, before moving to Northampton in 1982, where she managed the women's bookstore Womonfyre. She identifies as a gender non-conforming lesbian and has been a lesbian feminist activist during her entire adult life. During the early 1990s, Sorrell spent four years in San Francisco working for the San Francisco Ballet, the Women's Philharmonic, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and Planned Parenthood.</p>
                  <p>Throughout much of her adult life, Sorrell has worked in the non-profit arts, politics, public health and human services, but considers her most profound work to be that as a Justice of the Peace. To date, she has officiated for over 700 same- and opposite sex couples from all over the world, the country and local. In her work as an ombudsman director at Highland Valley, Sorrell advocates for LGBT older adults and conducts cultural competence training regarding race, sexual orientation and gender identity for health care professionals.</p>
                  <p>Sorrell was raised Catholic and now identifies as Buddhist. </p>

                  <p>In this oral history JM Sorrell talk about her experiences growing up as a tomboy, moving often, dealing with her mother's alcoholism and going to Catholic school. Sorrell describes how she came out as a lesbian and first discovered feminism at the University of Kentucky in Lexington and her experience of the lesbian feminist community in Northampton. She talks about her experience living and working in San Francisco and the ways its many forms of diversity influenced her view of the community when she came back to Northampton. One focus of the interview lies on Sorrell's work as an activist and a Justice of the Peace since the Supreme Judicial Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage in Massachusetts 2003 and her role in fighting against its repeal. Sorrell explains the role of marriage equality as a tool for social change and LGBT issues that still need to be addressed. She details the evolution of the Northampton Pride march and the arguments concerning bisexual inclusion in 1989 and reflects on how the march has changed since then. The interview closes with a discussion of the issues facing the older LGBT community and Sorrell's work to create welcoming and normative environments in hospitals and rest homes.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, narrator Michele Spring-Moore discusses growing up as an introverted child in Rochester, NY and her process of coming to terms with her bisexual identity as a young adult while navigating her opinions of queer figures in media and her neighborhood. She also describes communities forming around showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the local lesbian resource center in Rochester. Much of the interview focuses on the activist work Spring-Moore was involved with as an editor for an LGBTQ newspaper in Rochester, The Empty Closet, as well as her work in co-founding two social support groups for bisexual women, in Rochester and Boulder, CO. She details the struggles faced by the bisexual community in the LGBTQ community at large, as well as her own struggle to accept her attraction to people of all genders. The interview ends with a reflection on the activist work Spring-Moore does today in the Northampton community and at her job at a progressive philanthropic foundation.</p>

                  <p>Perri Neri Zimmerman (b. 1959) is a painter who grew up on the east coast of Florida and earned her MFA from Pratt Institute in 2007. Zimmerman had her first solo show, Heaven and Hell, in Ybor City in 1992; today, she is a member of Ceres Gallery, a not-for-profit women's art collective in Manhattan, which she is interested in expanding to include young up-and-coming women artists and art students.

                  <p>In this oral history Perri Neri Zimmerman describes her Catholic upbringing with her brothers and single mother, her close relationship to the gay male community forged through disco dancing, and her experiences with marriage and domestic partnership. The interview focuses on the role of painting as an expressive outlet, a healing project, and a social tool throughout her life, the connections she made working in the cosmetology circuit, and on her experiences as a lesbian mom. Zimmerman's story illustrates an east Floridian snapshot of the disco era, the AIDS crisis, single motherhood, lesbian dating and courtship strategies in the late '90s, and the impact of marriage (in)equality on daily lesbian life.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Portia Cornell describes her childhood in an upper-class family living on a farm just outside of New York City and her later experiences in lesbian feminist groups in New England of the 1970s and onwards. Cornell covers topics such as being a lesbian teacher in schools, the Hartford, Connecticut bar scene, sexual assault, "coming out" as bipolar to her family, moving to Hartford, Connecticut, the Pioneer Valley, and eventually Gainesville, Florida. She spends a little time talking about her experiences as a lesbian and a bipolar woman in all of these communities, including the retirement community she currently resides in with her wife, Lynne Kimmel. She also discusses her experiences being raised Quaker and the lasting effect that has had on her worldviews and activism.</p>

                  <p>Rosemary "Rosie" Heidkamp (b. 1958) was born in Evanston, IL and lived in Levittown, NJ, outside of Johannesburg, South Africa, and Melrose, MA throughout her childhood. Her early experience of rural life in South Africa gave Heidkamp a taste for what she would end up loving and searching for for years. After a few semesters at UMass Amherst, Heidkamp joined Ant Rockies, a commune in Leverett, MA, where she lived from 1979 until 1985, when she and a group of friends decided to buy their own piece of land. During the same time, Heidkamp participated in war tax resistance and sit-ins to stop the construction of nuclear plants. In 1986, Heidkamp moved to Wendell and, over the course of several years, built her own house and created a community that lived by its "Back to the Land" values. Since arriving in Wendell, Heidkamp has also become very involved with the Wendell library, and what began as just filling in a few hours a week turned into applying for and receiving a million dollar grant to implement a new library building in 2006. Since taking over the library, Heidkamp has poured herself into making it a vibrant center of Wendell's little community.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Jane McMahon describes her childhood as the youngest of five in a lower middle-class Irish Catholic family. She then describes her college years where she had her first girlfriend and was introduced to gay bars, feminist theory, liberal politics, and activism. The interview explores different women throughout McMahon's life that have had significant influence on the way she experiences the world, from being able to openly and confidently identify as a lesbian to expanding her greater political consciousness. As an educator, McMahon discusses her slow but sure professional coming out, how she strived for her classroom to always be a safe space for students, and the importance of representation in literature and media in correlation with more widespread LGBT acceptance. She also complicates the legalization of same-sex marriage, laments the lack of active support from people without direct connections to the LGBT community, and stresses a love for her own circle of close lesbian friends.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Lisbeth Melendez-Rivera describes growing up in an upper-middle class Catholic family in Puerto Rico and her experience coming to the mainland US by herself to attend an all women's Catholic college in Boston in the 1980s, during the height of the AIDS crisis. The interview focuses on her experience as a lesbian of color working at a hospital during the AIDS epidemic and LGBT life and women's/feminist spaces in Boston during this time period. Rivera also details the influence that Leslie Feinberg, author of Stone Butch Blues, had on her, how she came to present as butch, her relationship with her femme wife, LGBT representation in the media today, and comments on the current relationship between Puerto Rico and the mainland US.

                  <p>In this oral history, Diane Curtis describes her childhood in a working-class divorced family and how she got into activist work while attending college in New York. She talks about her work with ACT UP, WHAM!, the Pink Panthers, and the atmosphere and communities of gay activists in New York City at the time (80s-90s.)

                  <p>In this oral history, Carolyn Dull describes her childhood in Virginia with a bipolar and extremely religious father, strong mother, and three brothers. She details her experiences as a child raised in an extremely religious household and how that has made her wary of and uninterested in religion; her experiences as a musician, growing up with rock n' roll, and as a founding member of the country rock band Whiskey Creek; she also describes her work history as a food service worker who moved up to work as an accountant, business manager, and chief financial officer at various community service boards and other organizations; her fragmented school history, in which she left college after a year and then slowly got her associate's and bachelor's degrees; and how she became mayor of Staunton, Virginia. Dull discusses her early marriage as a result of an unplanned pregnancy, and subsequently meeting her future wife. Halfway through the interview, her wife, Salome Baugher, enters the interview to share her side of the story, and to talk about her experience with religion, specifically the Mennonite faith, and how their relationship, though legal, is not public knowledge because of Salome's family.</p>

                  <p>Carolyn Dull (b. 1951) was born in Leesburg, Virginia, and moved to Staunton, Virginia at six months old, where she has lived ever since. She has been interested and involved with music, specifically rock n' roll, for as long as she can remember, and played in multiple bands before founding the country rock band Whiskey Creek in the early 1980s. She grew up with a religious father who was an Independent Baptist preacher, whom she did not get along with. She spent a year at William and Mary before becoming pregnant with her first and only daughter in 1972, and marrying her boyfriend at the time. She worked in food service until getting her AAS in Accounting from Blue Ridge Community College in 1982 and her BS in Management and Organizational Development from Eastern Mennonite University in 1997. She then worked as an accountant, a business manager, and a CFO at various organizations before retiring in 2015. She ran for a city council position in 2006, and then was elected as Vice Mayor of Staunton, Virginia in 2012, and then was elected to Mayor in 2014. She recently was reelected as Mayor for another four years.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Judith Frank describes her childhood and family dynamics, and their transition to Israel in 1976. She talks about her college experiences in Israel, especially in comparison to the typical U.S. college experience, and what it was like to come back to the U.S. for graduate school. In doing so, she also touches upon how her gender and sexuality have been shaped by these life experiences of family and place. The interview focuses on her work as an author that explores issues including sexuality, butchness, politics, and religion, and how these novels were shaped by her own personal experiences. Frank also delves into her passion for teaching, and the important role she believes that education has in the world. In telling her story, she details her experiences of both mental and physical health, and how those have shaped her familial relationships and her relationship to her own body and self. Frank also discusses what it means to be a queer parent, as well as how aging and being an older parent have influenced that.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Bobbie Geary shares her story of growing up in Long Island with a religious, working-class family. As the oldest child out of eight, Geary describes how her role of being the eldest daughter affected her gender expression and relationship with the important adults in her life as she grew up. Through the support of the strong women in her life, Geary speaks of how she got involved with her passion in writing and familiarity with lesbians and feminism. After moving to Manhattan, Geary recalls her experiences with therapy and coming to terms with her lesbian identity. This interview explicitly shows the various ways one can use their interests to become political, for Geary recounts her personal role in starting a lesbian press. Geary also recounts the bar scene of the fifties to seventies, which provides insight as to how different lesbian identities (such as the radicalesbians and sex radicals) evolved throughout LGBTQ+ history. In other words, Geary's interview illustrates the ways therapy, lesbian-only spaces, and family dynamics has shaped the way she views and values her lesbianism.</p>

                  <p>Roberta "Bobbie" Geary (b. 1940) grew up in an Irish-Catholic household in Long Island, New York, and is the oldest of her seven siblings. Geary has had a passion for reading and writing since she was young, which was fueled by her grandmother's and great-aunts' support. Geary graduated from Hunter College of CUNY with a BA in psychology, and was introduced to publishing in New York City in the 1970s. While Geary has lived in several states as a freelance writer and editor, she currently resides in Easthampton with her partner of thirty years, Sandy. While Geary emphasizes the fact that she does not call herself political, Geary and her partner are founders of the lesbian press, The Graeae Press, and identify as "proud lesbians."</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Pat Griffin describes how her 7th grade gym teacher, an Olympic swimmer, transformed her life into that of an athlete. Her passion and devotion to sports are what allowed her to pursue three sports at the University of Maryland: swimming, basketball, and field hockey. In the interview, she describes her years in college as some of her best years because she was the star on all three teams. Simultaneously though, she developed feelings for one of her basketball teammates. The interview focuses on this relationship and the various ones in-between before she met her wife, Kathy. Aside from the relationships with important figures in her life, the interview discusses her professional career at the University of Massachusetts as a professor in Social Justice Education and her personal life in the Pioneer Valley. The end of the interview focuses on her life in the present and the work she does with building common ground between the LGBTQ population and faith-based colleges and universities.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Lisa Hohenemser discusses the trajectory of her life from her childhood to her goals for the future. She talks about realizing she was a lesbian in college, and the struggles of often being unable to be identified as a lesbian. She characterizes herself in several ways as "walking in two worlds", meaning that in many aspects she finds herself part of one group and part of another. Some examples include her status as a child of German immigrant parents and her sexuality and visibility. An important element of this oral history is Lisa's relationship with her children and partner, and her experiences as a lesbian mother. She also discusses her work with AIDS education in the late 1980s and 1990s, when the crisis was at its peak. She ends with her goals for the future as her children are growing up and becoming independent, giving her the time to go back to work, in whatever form that may take.</p>

                  <p>Tryna Hope (b. 1943) grew up in Gary, Indiana and Birmingham, Alabama in an Orthodox Jewish household, obtained her Bachelor's degree in Anthropology from University without Walls, and earned her Master's in Social Work from the University of Connecticut. Until beginning her career in social work, her employment history began in her 30s with erasing stray pencil marks from tests and included record producer for Linda Shear's A Lesbian Portrait (Lesbian Music For Lesbians Only), tax consultant, paralegal, group home Advisor, and assistant manager from a woman's group home. She has also written for small women's print publications. She was involved in the Jane Collective in the early 1970s and co-founded the Northampton chapter of Old Lesbians Organizing for Change in the mid-2010s. In 1974 and 1975, she fought for custody of her daughter in the Hampshire County court, and she was one of the few out lesbian/gay people in the country to eventually obtain child custody.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Tryna Hope describes her childhood in Birmingham, Alabama as a middle-class, Jewish youth. She briefly talks about her experience with childhood sexual abuse and examines the effects of this abuse throughout her life. The interview focuses on her involvement with activist communities in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois during the late-1960s and early 19070s, her experiences as a lesbian separatist and lesbian mother, and her career as a social worker. At the end of the interview, she also talks about her experiences as an elder and about the shifts she has noted in the lesbian community, primarily regarding the decreased use of the word "lesbian." Hope's story reflects her own journey towards forgiveness/reconciliation with herself and her chosen communities, expands the definition of "coming out" to encompass different aspects of self, and traces her pathway to social work. It also provides insight into tension between separatist and non-separatist lesbians during the 1970s, benefits and limitations of therapy, and some of the intergenerational tensions within the LGBT community (e.g. elder erasure and the loss of "lesbian").</p>

                  <p>Reba Knickerbocker was born in Connecticut in 1966, and, following her parents' divorce, moved with her mother to Oakland, California when she was six. Reba attended Mills College, where she joined the rowing team, and she graduated in 1997 as a nontraditional student. She went on to get her Master's in Exercise and Sports Studies from Smith College in 2003 and has worked various jobs coaching crew since then, the most significant of which was her time as head women's coach at Willamette University.

                  <p>CJ Lammers (b. 1959) works at The Conway School, helping graduate students create sustainable environmental solutions through a project in the community. She has a BA in Forestry from Southern Illinois University (1981) and a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning with a specialization in Environmental Planning from the University of Virginia (1995).

                  <p>In this oral history, CJ Lammers (b. 1959) describes her childhood living in a strict, mostly male household in Peoria, IL and Aurora, IL as the fifth of six kids. She talks about her college years working in the dish room as the only woman, working on her degree in Forestry. After college, CJ moved to DC where she stayed for over a decade. Working in the environmental field, from Arborist Inspector to environmental planning, CJ was laid off twice in four years from federal budget cuts. This interview covers her coming out as butch in the early 2000s, and what that identity has meant to her, and what it was like being both closeted and out in the work place. CJ married her wife Sarah four time, the first time in 1996 in a commitment ceremony, and most recently in California, resulting in CJ and Sarah becoming de facto plaintiffs in the Prop 8 Supreme Court case that federally legalized same-sex marriage. The interview ends with her discussion of the local politics in Chesterfield, MA and her dedication to conservation.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Amy Meblin describes growing up in a left-wing family on the San Francisco Peninsula. She knew from the age of 11 that she was attracted to women but remained closeted until 1972 when she attended Linda Shear's concert at the University of Illinois and encountered lesbian feminist culture. The interview covers her early family life in California and her social and professional life in Massachusetts. Meblin describes Boston's bar scene in the 1970s and also emphasizes the "out" culture in her workplaces, notably at the Fernald School and at her current place of employment, the Franklin Community Co-op. Meblin reflects on the conditions of her life that have allowed for what she experienced as a relative amount of freedom and mobility, both in terms of her material life and her identity, noting a sense of comfort moving between different social worlds. The interview also covers Meblin's current family life, including her marriage to her partner of 33 years, following the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2008, and her experiences parenting a child that she senses to be queer as well.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Zelda Saeli describes her childhood growing up on a family farm in New York state. She grew up in a Catholic family, and her experiences growing up reflect the farm life: she reports the freedom she had to play as a tomboy. In college, she participated in anti-war protests and came out as a lesbian. The interview is an autobiography of her life and focuses on her relationship with the gay and lesbian movement, the women's movement, her move to San Francisco, the social activism in the City, and how she navigates her relationships in this context. Zelda's story details the ways she used the challenges from her childhood and family experiences to make meaningful contributions to marginalized communities, especially through her work with low-income women. Her interview illustrates the most significant historical events of the gay and lesbian movement through the 1970s and 1980s and beyond, including the assassination of Harvey Milk, the Briggs Initiative, the bar scene in San Francisco, the legal struggle for domestic partnership and same-sex second parent adoption, and the federal recognition of gay marriage.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history Michelle Valois describes her upbringing in a working-class, blue-collar family in central Massachusetts and her experiences during the ten years she spent in Stockholm, Sweden; for a semester abroad when she was in college and then after graduating from college from 1984-1994. The interview focuses on her time growing up as a lesbian in a place where she did not have any support or role models, and then going to college and discovering a new part of herself. She speaks of an aunt who never married and was very important to her whilst growing up by helping her realize the potential life she could live where her livelihood was not ruled by men or a husband. She describes her time in Sweden as being helpful for her to develop her political views, and she now sees a social democracy with regulated capitalism and a big safety net for individuals as the ideal political system. She considers herself culturally Swedish and speaks fondly of her time spent there. Her story of growing up with no lesbian representation culminates in her role as an advisor for the GSA at the college at which she works, and she tells anecdotes of queer students coming to her for support.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>In this oral history, Karen Warren describes her childhood in a rural, working-class family in Milfrod, Michigan; her career as an outdoor leader, social justice educator, and writer; her memories of living in Western Massachusetts over the past few decades, and her life with her wife and daughters. In particular, this interview focuses on her experiences coming out as a lesbian in the rural Midwest before moving to Western Massachusetts and becoming involved in the lesbian community there (especially in relation to the outdoors), and her subsequent experiences adopting and raising two children with her wife, Sue. We also talk extensively about her work teaching at Hampshire College, her experiences with her students, and her social justice advocacy there. Her stories are a part of both Midwestern and Massachusetts lesbian history from the 1980s to the present, and illustrate the overlap between lesbian and outdoor communities.</p>
