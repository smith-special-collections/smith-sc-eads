         <p>Willa Sibert Cather (1876-1947) was an American writer who established herself as an outstanding regionalist writer with her books, short stories, and poems centered around her childhood on a ranch outside of Red Cloud, Nebraska, and the pioneering spirit of nineteenth century immigrant families who moved to the Great Plains. Born outside of Winchester, Virginia, her family moved to Nebraska, where she attended high school and then college at the University of Nebraska (1891-95). She then moved to Pittsburgh, PA and worked for a newspaper before becoming a teacher and beginning her writing career with her first book of poems, <title>April Twilights.</title> She joined the McClure's Magazine staff in New York and became managing editor, but after the publication of her first novel, <title>Alexander's Bridge,</title> in 1912, she left her magazine job to pursue writing full-time.</p>
         <p>Grant Martin Overton (1887-1930) was an American journalist and fiction writer, and possible reviewer of Cather's books.</p>
