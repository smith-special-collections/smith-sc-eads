      <abstract id="aspace_20a45a12363169f2c1a07b227fe5270c">Carol Waldron (1925-2008) was a mother
        of four who divorced her husband, became self-sufficient, and was active in the Lexington,
        Massachusetts branch of the National Organization for Women (NOW) in the 1970s. She was also
        diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1966. This collection consists primarily of her
        personal diaries, which are extraordinary both for their completeness and their candor about
        Waldron's life and feelings.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Carol Willis Talmage was born November 10, 1925 to Ila Hoag Talmage and Harry Talmage. She
        married Steven Waldron and with him had four children: Christopher (1945), Nicholas (1949),
        Deborah (1953), and Abigail (1956). She divorced Steven Waldron in 1971; became financially
        self-sufficient, learning to repair cars and taking in lodgers, among other things; and
        served as chair of the Lexington, Massachusetts branch of the National Organization for
        Women (NOW) in the 1970s. According to a 1977 legal document, Waldron was a"blood recruiter"
        at that time. Waldron was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis around 1966; her daughter,
        Deborah also has the same disease. Carol Waldron died on March 8, 2007 in Lexington,
        Massacusetts.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection consists primarily of Carol Waldron's diaries, which are extraordinary both
        in providing an almost-complete, factual life history and in offering rich documentation of
        Waldron's inner life. Entries are profoundly reflective and analytical, and unflinchingly
        honest regarding self and others. Among other deeply personal topics, Waldron writes at
        length about her unhappy marriage and its gradual demise, and about the process of aging.
        The diaries begin during her teenage years in the 1930's and continue into her 70's. Legal
        documents pertaining to Waldron's divorce and to a suit filed by Waldron against the John
        Hancock Life Insurance Co. are also included.</p>
