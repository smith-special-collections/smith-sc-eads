         <p>These maps are formerly plates in published books that were removed and sold separately. Louis Wilson purchased them after this book-breaking took place. (Book-breaking to sell illustrative plates separately is, sadly, a common practice across time.) There is insufficient information for the curator to determine from which books these maps were removed.</p>

         <p>These maps were accepted from a larger quantity offered by the donor as examples of how parts of Africa were represented and described in the Anglo-American world over time. They were acquired for teaching context and interpretation in the dissemination of geographical and cultural knowledge.</p>
