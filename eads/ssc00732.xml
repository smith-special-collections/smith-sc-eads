         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>E. Carolyn Innes and G. David Waldron co-founded the Gay Nurses'Alliance (GNA) in Philadelphia, PA, in August 1973 to advocate for gay patients and nurses and educate health care professionals and others. Encouraged by her mentor Barbara Gittings, Innes approached Waldron with the idea of establishing a gay caucus within the American Nurses Association. While the plan didn't evolve exactly that way, Innes, Waldron, their partners, and one other nurse, began to organize an independent Alliance. In October of 1973 they gave the presentation"Gay People/Straight Health Care" at the Pennsylvania Nurses Association conference. Though they were not officially recognized by the Association or conference, response to the talk was so positive that they repeated it to another packed room the following morning. Chapters of GNA were established in Boston, MA and New York City, NY. Chapter membership fees, combined with personal funds, enabled Innes and Waldron to attend the American Nurses Association Convention in San Francisco. They also began doing numerous speaking engagements. In 1977 GNA had its first annual conference. Though the organization continued to grow, by 1978 lack of member involvement prompted John C. Lawrence, president and National Coordinator East, and Bob Miller, secretary of the Alliance, to consider disbanding unless others stepped forward. By the early 1980s the Alliance was defunct.</p>
