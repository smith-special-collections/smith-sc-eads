         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Leslie Tarr Laurie was born in New York City, the daughter of Elvira (Vera) Rosenfeld Tarr, a professor of education at Brooklyn College, and Philip Tarr, owner of the Hefley and Brown School for Court Reporting, also in Brooklyn. She grew up in Great Neck, New York and attended area schools through high school. She earned a B.A. from Chatham College in Pittsburgh where she met her husband, Bruce Laurie, a US labor historian and professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Leslie Laurie then earned a M.S. from Columbia University and served as Director of Education and Outreach at Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania before she and her husband moved to western Massachusetts in 1970. In her own words, she "was appalled that there were no subsidized family planning services" in this rural portion of the Commonwealth (David Cline, <title render="italic">Creating Choice</title>, 2006, p243). Setting out to change that, Laurie first worked for the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts (PPLM), then based in Newton Centre, just outside of Boston, as the first community organzier for the western part of the state.
 
 But she never felt that PPLM fully supported her efforts. The Family Planning Council of Western Massachusetts (later known as Tapestry Health Systems) was founded in 1973 by Leslie Tarr Laurie and others to provide family planning services (birth control, pregnancy testing, referral for adoption and abortion services) and other health services (STD testing, gynecological exams). Its programs expanded into about 12 clinics in western Massachusetts and into other family planning and health care areas (teenage pregnancy, AIDS, smoking cessation, WIC, needle exchange programs, and so forth). Laurie would serve as CEO/Executive Director of the agency she founded for the next 40 years until her resignation in early 2014. Since then, while remaining active in community-based public health initiatives, she has been working on establishing a medical marijuana clinic in Northampton, Massachusetts.</p>
