         <p>Mary Daly started donating her papers to the Sophia Smith Collection in 2009. In 2010, after Mary Daly's death, many of the women in Daly's community continued to send her materials, and added materials related to Daly's death and memorial services.  Materials were recieved from Nancy Kelly, Mary E. Hunt, Jean E. MacRae, and Linda Barufaldi.</p>

         <head>Arrangement</head>
         <p>The collection is arranged into four series: Professional materials, Writings, Correspondence, and Personal records.  Series are arranged roughly in the order they arrived at the archive (i.e. materials sent to us in 2009 are located before materials sent in 2010).  Oversize, AV, digital, ephemera, and books appear at the end of each series.</p>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Mary Daly, a radical feminist philosopher and theologian who referred to herself as a Positively Revolting Hag, was born in Schnectady, New York, in 1928, the only child of a homemaker mother  and a traveling salesman father. She was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools. Early in her childhood, Daly had mystical experiences in which she felt the presence of divinity in nature.</p>

         <p>She received a BA in English from the College of St. Rose in Albany, NY in 1950; an MA from Catholic University of America in 1952; and a Ph.D. in Religion from the School of Sacred Theology, St. Mary's, Notre Dame, in 1954. Unable to find a school in America that would allow a woman to obtain a"canonical" Doctorate in Sacred Theology, she went to Fribourg, Switzerland, where the education was state-controlled and could not legally exclude women. There she received a Doctorate in Theology and a Ph.D. in Philosophy as well as a Licentiate in Sacred Theology.</p>

         <p>When she returned to the United States in 1966, she took a tenure track position at Boston College. Her first book, <title render="italic">The Church and the Second Sex</title> (1968) was influenced by a visit to Rome during Vatican II. The book, called a "searing expose of Christian misogyny, especially in the Catholic Church," critiqued the patriarchal structure of the Catholic Church and its detrimental effect on shaping women's lives and self-image. The book established Daly as a radical feminist theologian and a powerful voice of dissension, and Boston College fired her soon after its publication. However, amidst student protests and public outcry, Daly was reinstated and given tenure.</p> 

         <p>She went on to teach at Boston College for thirty-three years and published seven more books: <title render="italic">Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism</title> (1978), <title render="italic">Pure Lust: Elemental Feminist Philosophy</title> (1984), <title render="italic">Beyond God the Father</title> (1985), <title render="italic">Webster's First New Intergaliactic Wickedary of the English Language</title> (with Jane Caputi; 1987), <title render="italic">Outercourse</title> (1992), <title render="italic">Quintessence</title> (1998), and <title render="italic">Amazon Grace</title> (2006).</p>

         <p>Daly regularly toured nationally and internationally, lecturing, speaking and teaching at over three hundred college and universities. In addition to her own work, Daly was connected to many other feminist scholars, theologians, philosophers, and radicals of her day including Adrienne Rich, Diana Davies, Andrea Dworkin, Artemis March, Sonia Johnson, Jane Caputi, Merlin Stone, Janice Raymond, Robin Morgan, Julia Penelope, Gloria Steinem, Roseanne Barr, Pauli Murray, Linda Barufaldi, and Emily Culpepper. Daly retired from Boston College in 1999, although she claimed she was forced to do so. She died in Gardner, Massachusetts in January 2010.</p>

         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>The collection came to the Smith Special Collections in seven instalments, starting when Daly was alive and continuing after her death with a few boxes of personal materials and materials related to her death.  The collection was in considerable disorder when it came to us, with all types of materials mixed together, much without any labels.  This is partially due to the collection being sent over the course of years, and partially due to Daly's death in 2010, which caused much of the collection to be boxed and sent without her overseeing the process.</p>
         <p>In 2019, a team of processors began to reorganize the collection.  The team was made up of Madison White, Scott Biddle, Sylvia Hickman, and two student workers, Sky Karp and Isabel Montesanto.  First we removed all student grades and assessments.  We put all unfoldered materials into folders and rewrote illegible labels.  Folder titles were kept as much as possible, but when titles were inaccurate or missing titles were created.  </p>
         <p>While refoldering and weeding the collection, we noticed groupings of 5-20 folders on correspondence, writings, Boston College materials, and personal records, which implied that these had once been series within the collection.  For example, we found sections of correspondence in alphaqbetical order (e.g. correspondnce G-K), which implied that there had once been a file of correspondence A-Z.  We therefore decided to seperate the collection into these four series, keeping each series in roughly the order that it arrived to us (i.e. materials that came to the archives in 2009 are before materials from 2010).  We assumed that there had been some logic to the groupings, even when it was not clear to us, and therefore we tried to keep groupings of material together.  Because of this, there are a number of "miscellaneous" or "general" folders throughout the collection, which contain materials that were located together in a box with no obvious link.  Once we seperated materials into series, we did not arrange materials any further.</p>
         <p>The contents of 10 floppy disks in this collection has been copied to networked storage for preservation and access; 3 disks could not be copied in-house and have been flagged  for future preservation work; 3 disks were blank and were discarded.</p>

               <p>This series contains the professional records of Daly. Included in this series are course materials spanning much of Daly's career at Boston College, including syllabi and class notes, course evaluations and correspondence with current and former students, including Janice Raymond, later author of the controversial <title render="italics">The Transsexual Empire</title>. This series also includes legal documents, letters of support, clippings from the press, and fundraising documents related to Daly's "harassment" by Boston College and the Center for Individual Rights regarding her application for tenure and her refusal to teach male and female students together. Researchers can also find flyers, schedules and some correspondence related to Daly's speaking engagements and conferences. More correspondence about Boston College disputes and speaking engagements can be found in the correspondence series.  Records related to Daly's writing career and book tours can be found in writings.</p>

Some files contain no correspondence, just materials relating to the person listed- a name listed is not a guarantee Daly maintained correspondence with that person. There are also organizational and academic newsletters and ephemera as well as subject files interspersed in the series.</p>
