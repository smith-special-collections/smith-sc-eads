         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Born in 1932 in San Francisco, Dian Fossey was raised by her well-to-do mother and step-father, Hazel and Richard Price (her parents were divorced). Fossey studied animal husbandry at the University of California at Davis for two years and graduated from San Jose State in 1955 with a degree in occupational therapy. For eleven years, she worked in a children's hospital in Louisville, KY. In 1963, she went to Africa, and by 1966, she lived there permanently. She became Louis Leakey's"gorilla girl,"and eventually was sponsored by the National Geographic Society, setting up camp in Zaire (then the Congo) and later Rwanda. She worked on a Ph.D. at Cambridge in the 1970s. She fought poachers in and around her base camp, Karisohe, and amidst increasingly tense relations between the local tribe and Fossey regarding the mountain gorillas, on Christmas Eve of 1985, she was found murdered. The case was never solved.</p>
