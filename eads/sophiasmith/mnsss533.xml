            of Indian education." The collection includes audio recordings, partial transcripts,
            related correspondence and published documents. A large percentage of the interviews are

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>According to oral historian Jerry Reynolds, who conducted the 60 interviews that
            comprise the heart of this collection, "The Archival interviews and research on the
            Coalition of Indian Controlled School Boards fill a gaping empty page in the
            contemporary annals of Indian Country, and of America's social justice movement at
            large. The interviews contain a unique, otherwise unknowable history. From before its
            official incorporation in 1971 to its demise in 1981, the Coalition made unrivaled
            contributions to Indian parental and community control of Indian education. In 1974, in
               <title render="italic">Education and the American Indian: The Road to
               Self-Determination Since 1928</title>, scholar Margaret Connell Szasz wrote, 'In its
            first year, the coalition provided technical assistance in all aspects of education for
            Indian school boards, communities, and organizations, and served as a clearing house for
            information on legislation and other matters pertaining to Indian education. Less than
            two years after it was formed, CICSB was serving eighty-seven schools and
            organizations.' In the same year, Vine Deloria Jr. put the case for the Coalition in
            still stronger terms. Writing in 'The Indian Affair' that of the organizations forged to
            'carry the fight to the Bureau' after the Bureau of Indian Affairs' decision to outflank
            self-determination on the battleground of educational programs and policies, Deloria
            states: 'The most important of these [organizations] is the Coalition of Indian
            Controlled School Boards ... now working with over a hundred local Indian school boards
            in trying to take over the education of reservation and urban Indian children. The
            Coalition is the most efficient and sophisticated organization that Indian country has
            ever seen and is far more capable than the Indian political groups ... in getting
            changes made.' Deloria went on to describe the Coalition's successful lawsuit against
            President Richard M. Nixon's administration for the release of impounded Indian
            education funds. 'The Coalition thus accomplished more for Indians in one lawsuit than
            the activists have by any of their celebrated events, for the monies went directly into
            Indian controlled school districts and allowed the reservation people to begin
            development of their educational institutions. The year after Szasz and Deloria wrote
            their contemporary testimonials, the Coalition was the principal reason the '638' law of
            1975 is entitled 'The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.'"</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection includes interviews with individuals who made "unrivaled contributions to
            Indian parental and community control of Indian education." There are audio recordings,
            abstracts and partial transcripts most interviews. A large percentage of the interviews
            are with women, many of whom were involved in the Indian rights movement, including
            Rebecca Adamson who was the first field coordinator for the coalition (note: Rebecca
            Adamson's papers are also housed in the Sophia Smith Collection). According to oral
            historian Jerry Reynolds, 46 of the 97 interviewees were women. "Women played a decisive
            role in the Coalition's accomplishments both as committed parents and political
            catalysts." </p>
         <p>The collection also includes audio recordings of the conference: Struggle for
            Self-Determination in Education: Its On-going Value, at Wyoming Indian High School,
            2006; plus related correspondence, memos, articles, published and unpublished
            manuscripts, books, legal documents, and government reports.</p>
