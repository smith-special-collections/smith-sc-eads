         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Pat Schneider was born in 1934 in a St. Louis, MO, slum and was educated with money from a bequest to a nearby church. She received a B.A. from Central College, Fayette, MO (1956), a M.A. from Pacific School of Religion, Berkeley, CA (1959), and a M.F.A. in Creative Writing from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (1979). At the time that she was completing her degree at Pacific School of Religion, she married a Methodist minister. They spent 15 years in an Amherst, MA parish with a strong outreach program. Ordered to cease and desist by the local Methodist district supervisor, she and her husband both left the church circa 1980. Schneider was an adjunct faculty member at Smith College School of Social Work and the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, CA. She has taught creative writing workshops at the University of Massachusetts and in Sligo and Dublin, Ireland. She has also been Playwright in Residence at Pacific School of Religion. A writer of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and plays, Schneider is the founder/director of Amherst Writers and Artists, which sponsors several year-round workshops in creative writing. Her long time work with low-income families in mill town housing projects in the Connecticut River Valley has brought about the establishment of Amherst Writers and Artists Institute which sponsors free writing workshops for low-income women, children, and adolescents. The Institute has also sent children and single mothers to summer camp, assisted single mothers to resume their interrupted educations, and offers training in workshop leadership. Schneider has appeared on National Public Radio and has given presentations and trainings throughout the U.S., Ireland and in Japan.</p>
