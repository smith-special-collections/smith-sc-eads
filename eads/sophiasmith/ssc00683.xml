         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Dázon Dixon Diallo is founder and president of SisterLove, Inc., established in 1989, the first women's HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Justice organization in the southeastern United States. She grew up in the small town of Fort Valley, Georgia, the eldest of three children of Clinton H. and Virginia J. Dixon. As a student at Spelman College, Dázon took a leading role in anti-apartheid work. After attending the First National Conference on Black Women's Health Issues, which was held at Spelman in June, 1983, she sought out community women's health work. She earned her B.A. from Spelman in 1986. From 1984 to 1989, she was a lay health worker at the Feminist Women's Health Center in Atlanta, where she was the only woman of color on staff. Struck by the need to address HIV and AIDS among women, she and others founded SisterLove in 1989. At a time when AIDS was considered a risk primarily for gay white men, SisterLove provided safe space for women, especially women of African descent, to confront the realities of living with the disease. Dixon has participated in major international women's health gatherings, including International Women and Health Meetings in Manila 1990 and Uganda 1993, the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, the 1995 UN Women's Conference in Beijing, and the 2004 Cairo Plus Ten Conference in London. Seeking to learn from and work with other women in the African diaspora, Dixon initiated collaboration between SisterLove and a women's AIDS group in Johannesburg. In 1999, with funding from the Centers for Disease Control, she established the Thembuhlelo HIV/AIDS Capacity Building Project in Mpumalanga, South Africa. In 2001, she opened a SisterLove program office in Mpumalanga, a rural South African Province near Johannesburg, where the project focus is capacity building and sustainable development for local women-led HIV/AIDS organizations. From 1999 to 2007, she was married to Elimane Amadou Diallo. She earned a Masters Degree in Public Health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1997. She has taught at area colleges and has hosted a progressive women's radio program for many years.
