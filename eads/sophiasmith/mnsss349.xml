         <p>Birth control advocate; Physician. Edris Roushan Rice-Wray Carson, M.D. (birth date unknown) attended Cornell University, where she was a member of the Alpha Phi sorority, and was a public health physician, primarily in Central America and Mexico. She was a faculty member of the Puerto Rico Medical School and medical director of the Puerto Rico Family Planning Association. She founded Mexico's first family planning clinic in Mexico City. In the late 1950s she headed the first, large scale, clinical trials of the birth control pill developed by Gregory Pincus and John Rock. She was the recipient of Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Margaret Sanger Award in 1978. She was of the Bahá'í faith. During the last days of her life, she lived in Cholula, Puebla, Mexico, and died at her home on February 19, 1990 in San Andres Cholula, accompanied by her daughters and grandchildren, where her surviving family still live.</p>
