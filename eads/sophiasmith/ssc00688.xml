         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Known as Kitty to her friends, family and colleagues, Kathryn Kish Sklar was born in Columbus, Ohio. Her parents were small business owners. She attended Radcliffe College, graduating magna cum laude with a degree in history and literature in 1965. By then, Sklar was also a wife and mother; her son Leonard was born in 1959, followed by her daughter Susan. She then went on to graduate school at the University of Michigan, earning a master's degree in 1967 and a Ph.D. in 1969. Her first teaching appointment was also at the University of Michigan until 1974 when Sklar went to the University of California at Los Angeles. She rose to the rank of full professor at UCLA, teaching there until 1988, the same year that she married fellow historian Tom Dublin. They both then moved to SUNY Binghamton until her retirement in 2011. Kathryn Kish Sklar was one of the pioneers of women's history in the 1970s. Her first book,"Catharine Beecher: A Study in Domesticity,"(1973) was followed by a dozen more books of which she was either the author or editor, along with numerous articles and chapters in books. Together, Sklar and Dublin have led countless workshops for teachers, at the high school level as well as for fellow college instructors. The two were also pioneers in the Digital Humanities when, in 1997 under the auspices of the Center for the Historical Study of Women and Gender which they founded at SUNY Binghamton, Sklar and Dublin launched the Web site,"Women and Social Movements,"replete with thousands of primary documents and explanatory text. Personally, Sklar has been a mentor to dozens of students over the years and has won numerous teaching awards as well as fellowships in recognition of her vast contribution to the field of women's history.</p>
