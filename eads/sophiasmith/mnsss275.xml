         <p>Actress Clara Morris was born in Toronto, probably 17 Mar 1847, the eldest child of a bigamous marriage. When she was three her father, whose name was La Montagne, was exposed as a bigamist and her mother moved with Clara to Cleveland, where they adopted Clara's grandmother's name, Morisson. Young Clara received only scanty schooling. In circa 1860 she became a ballet girl in the resident company of the Cleveland Academy of Music, shortening her name to Morris at that time. After nine years of training with that company she played a leading lady at Wood's Theatre in Cincinnati in 1869. She then appeared in Halifax, Nova Scotia for a summer and with Joseph Jefferson in Louisville before going to New York City in 1870. She made her New York debut in September in "Man and Wife," directed by Augustin Daly at his Fifth Avenue Theatre. The role had come to her by chance, but she made such an impression in it that Daly starred her in a series of highly emotional roles over the next three years in such plays as "No Name," "Delmonico's," "L'Article 47," "Alixe," "Jezebel," and "Madeline Morel." She left Daly in 1873 and in November of that year starred under A.M. Palmer's management in "The Wicked World" at the Union Square Theatre.</p>
         <p>  Over the next few years Morris had great successes in "Camille" in 1874, "The New Leah" in 1875, "Miss Multon" (an American version of a French version of "East Lynne"), her most popular role, in 1876, "Jane Eyre" in 1877, and "The New Magdalen" in 1882. She also toured extensively, especially in the 1880s, and everywhere mesmerized audiences with her emotional power. Although neither a great beauty nor a great artist, nor trained in elocution or stagecraft, she had an instinctive genius for portraying the impassioned and often suffering heroines of French melodrama. </p>
         <p> The passing of the vogue for that sort of theatre, together with her uncertain health, brought her career to a close in the 1890s. In retirement in Riverdale, New York, she contributed articles on acting to various magazines, wrote a daily newspaper column for ten years, and published numerous books, including <title render="italic">A Silent Singer</title>, 1899; <title render="italic">Little Jim Crow and Other Stories for Children</title>, 1900; <title render="italic">Life on the Stage: My Personal Experiences and Recollections</title>, 1901; <title render="italic">Stage Confidences</title>, 1902; <title render="italic">A Pasteboard Crown</title>, 1902; <title render="italic">The Trouble Woman, 1904</title>; <title render="italic">The Life of a Star</title>, 1906; <title render="italic">Left in Charge</title>, 1907; <title render="italic">New East Lynne</title>, 1908; <title render="italic">A Strange Surprise</title>, 1910; and <title render="italic">Dressing-Room Receptions</title>, 1911. In 1904 she returned to the stage in a revival of "The Two Orphans," and she later appeared in vaudeville. She died in New Canaan, Connecticut, on November 20, 1925.</p>
