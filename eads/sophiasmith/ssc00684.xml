Dázon Dixon Diallo initiated a collaboration with a local women's organization to improve access for all women and especially those of color. In 1987, the Women's AIDS Prevention Project (WAPP) was formed. In 1989, Ms. Diallo founded SisterLove Women's AIDS Project with the help of WAPP's Women of Color Advisory Board. The organization's name was changed to SisterLove, Incorporated in 1992. The SisterLove records include correspondence; financial records; workshop materials, including surveys of participants. In addition there are materials related to other organizations doing similar work: SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Health Collective, and the then Black Women's Health Project (now the Black Women's Health Imperative). The collection also includes pamphlets, handbooks, grant proposals, reports, and audiovisual materials.
 
 SisterLove began with education and outreach programs and has moved well beyond a prevention model. By adopting the self help process of the black women's health movement, SisterLove encourages women to break through the stigma in southern culture against speaking up about sex and race. Using a human rights framework, the group combines women's empowerment with action on the multiple challenges and risk factors that women confront including housing, drug use, poverty and violence, as well as reproductive health and sexual rights. In 1997, SisterLove became one of the sixteen founding members of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Health Collective.
 
 Seeking to learn from and work with other women in the African diaspora, Dixon initiated collaboration between SisterLove and a women's AIDS group in Johannesburg. In 1999, with funding from the Centers for Disease Control, she established the Thembuhlelo HIV/AIDS Capacity Building Project in Mpumalanga, South Africa. The Project combines women's empowerment with HIV/AIDS services and land reform efforts. SisterLove also provides training and assistance to other AIDS organizations around the world. In July, 2002 SisterLove established a satellite office in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa to provide day-to-day oversight and management of their work in this country.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>At a time when AIDS was considered a risk primarily for gay white men, SisterLove provided safe space for women, especially women of African descent, to confront the realities of living with the disease. Dázon Dixon Diallo initiated a collaboration with a local women's organization to improve access for all women and especially those of color. In 1987, the Women's AIDS Prevention Project (WAPP) was formed. In 1989, the lack of support for WAPP inspired Ms. Diallo to found SisterLove Women's AIDS Project with the help of WAPP's Women of Color Advisory Board. Three years later, in 1992, the organization's name was officially changed to SisterLove, Incorporated.
