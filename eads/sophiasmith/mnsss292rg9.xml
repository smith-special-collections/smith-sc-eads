         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The National YWCA photographic print collection consists of approximately 24,000 photographic images taken within the United States and abroad from the late 19th century through the first few years of the 21st. The majority of the photographs were taken by professional photographers for publicity use. A good portion of these document activities at Community YWCAs and were submitted to the National Association for use in its main serial The Association Monthly/Womans Press/YWCA Magazine. </p>
         <p>In addition to these publicity photographs, there are also a significant number of personal snapshots donated to the National Board Archives by retired staff members.</p>
         <p>The World War I-era section is particularly strong, with subjects ranging from U.S. Hostess Houses and Overseas Staff to the "Women at Work" war effort on both sides of the Atlantic. There is also a smaller collection of images documenting World War II, including scrapbook photos of Japanese Relocation Centers, United Community Defense Services trailer boom-towns and the history of the U.S.O.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the images taken within the United States are either from 1918 or from the late 1950s through early 1970s. Many of the Program section's broadest topics (Recreation, Students, Y-Teens) were taken in large part during the mid-1960s by staff photographer Carroll Aument, whose style is distinctive from that of other YWCA photographers.</p>
         <p>The majority of the images in all sections of the collection are in black and white. Color photographs taken in the 1970s-1990s are often lesser quality snapshots taken by YWCA staff members.</p>
         <p>Series 4 also contains three scripts for which no motion picture film exists in the collection.</p>

                     <p>Photographs of YWCA Peace Corps projects in Chile. In the early 1960's the YWCA of the USA developed international projects in partnership with the Peace Corps. Volunteers in Chile worked mainly with children and youth in camps, housing projects, kindergartens and a hospital for disabled children. YWCA Peace Corps volunteers are identified on the backs of most photographs. Following the photographs of program activities are photographs of "Peace Corps paintings." These materials are followed by a mounted series of photographs highlighting the work of volunteers in Chile likely prepared for a presentation or exhibit.</p>

                     <p>Photographs from health and health education programs of young women's Christian associations in India. Health education and treatment is a priority of club work in India, especially in rural areas. YWCA centers offer programs that include basic medical care, nutrition and health education. For rural areas, access to safe drinking water is also an important component to a health program. Photographs show women and families waiting for medical treatment, clean water projects, women at clinic appointments and children receiving milk as supplemental nutrition. Additional photographs include images of nurses training to give care, rural communities near YWCA centers and health education classes.</p>

A collaborative effort from the YWCA of Japan and advisory leaders from the YWCA of the USA, the YWCA of Kure brings Christianity and association programs to women in Kure. Among the influential leaders is Ms. Jean Begg. The scrapbook emphasizes the effect the programs have on the lives of women in the post-war society.</p>

                     <p>Public affairs programs and activities in the YWCA of the U.S.A. seek to educate members on important social, economic, and political issues in addition to facilitating actionable programs. Through the public affairs committee the YWCA of the U.S.A. developed a program of emphasis, released statements of position, collaborated with other organizations and supported members in partaking in advocacy. Photographed activities include a tutoring program sponsored by the public affairs committee, women engaged in political activity, YWCA Peace Network displays, voter registration programs, and additional public affairs activities from several local associations.</p>

                     <p>As part of their activities to work towards social, economic, and racial justice for all, the YWCA of the USA and its members participated in national and local demonstrations to raise awareness for issues important to the organization and its members. Photographed demonstrations include national events such as the 1963 March on Washington, the 1992 March for Women's Lives, and 1968 Solidarity day. Other marches and demonstrations address issues such as the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), peace and disarmament, abortion and reproductive rights, hunger, and violence against women. While the majority of the photographs are of protests, marches and demonstrations, there are also several photographs of the 1983 Rose Parade.</p>

                     <p>YWCA Job Corps was a program that provided lodging, basic education and job training for young women in need. The program was part of an initiative launched by the United States Department of Labor and the Economic Security Act. The YWCA of the USA program utilized its existing structure and expertise to train Job Corps members and provide basic education for the completion of high school equivalency exams, access to health care and counseling, and instruction in life skills through shared living responsibilities. Photographed job skills training include typing, dental assistance, medical assistant, military, office skills, and teacher's aide. In addition to their job skills training and development, YWCA Job Corps women were encouraged to develop personal interests and given opportunity for recreation. Photographed recreation activities include physical fitness, horseback riding, and swimming and include a photograph of Jack La Lanne demonstrating donated fitness equipment to "Miss Job Corps" Lanetta Madden.</p>

                        <p>The YWCA of the USA teen counseling project utilized questionnaires and workshops in select communities to gather input from teenage girls aged 15-19 on their needs and the extent to which these needs are being addressed in their communities. The result of the project was a pamphlet titled "Attention is needed...Action is called for." The project was planned and implemented by teens with the help of YWCA leaders. Photographs include workshop sessions in addition to the event announcing the publication of the final pamphlet and report.</p>

Later conferences were often co-ed and included delegates from student YMCA associations.</p>

                     <p>Photographs from southern regional conferences of student YWCA associations. Photographs appear to include images from African American southern student conferences, likely segregated from the white student conferences. One photograph identifies itself as "probably the earliest photograph of an all-Black group in the National Board Archives." dating the photographs between 1910 and 1914.</p>
