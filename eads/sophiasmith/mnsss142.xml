         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Author and magazine editor Helen Gurley Brown was born in Green Forest, Arkansas on 18 February 1922 to Ira and Cleo (Sisco) Gurley, both schoolteachers. Though the family was poor, Cleo quit teaching to rear her two daughters. In Helen's early childhood, the Gurleys moved to Little Rock when Ira was elected to the state legislature. He was killed in an elevator accident when Helen was ten. Cleo struggled to support her children in depression-era Arkansas, first moving back with family in the Ozark region, and then taking Helen and her older sister Mary to Los Angeles in the late 1930s. In Los Angeles, Mary contracted polio, which strained the Gurley's already grim financial condition. Despite hardship, Helen excelled socially and academically. She was active in leadership positions in several high school clubs and graduated class valedictorian.</p>
         <p> 	Helen Gurley spent a year at the Texas State College for Women and then returned to Los Angeles to put herself through Woodbury Business College. Cleo and Mary moved back to Arkansas but remained dependent on Helen's financial support, a situation which continued for the remainder of their lives. Helen graduated from Woodbury with a business degree in 1941 and took on a succession of secretarial jobs. The seventeenth job, at the advertising agency Foote, Cone, and Belding, was pivotal to Helen's future success.</p>
         <p> 	Helen Gurley worked as executive secretary to Don Belding. During this time, she won a <title render="italic">Glamour</title> magazine contest for "Girls of Taste" that awarded her a vacation and a wardrobe. She had an active dating life, including a romance with prizefighter Jack Dempsey. Gurley's hard work captured the attention of her boss, and at the suggestion of his wife, Don Belding experimented, allowing Helen to write advertising copy. She succeeded at the task, and moved from secretarial work to copywriting. She wrote ads for several accounts, won prizes for her copy, and by the late 1950s had become the best-paid female copywriter on the West Coast. </p>
         <p> 	In 1959, at the age of 37, Helen found a marriage partner in David Brown, a magazine and book editor who would become a film executive at the Twentieth Century Fox Studios, and later an independent producer. He was also an uncredited partner behind many of Helen's projects. After she found her advertising career stagnating at Foote, Cone, and Belding and then the Kenyon and Eckhardt Agency, it was David who encouraged her to write a book about her life as a single woman. The result, <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title> (1962), captured a <title render="italic">zeitgeist</title> of the early 1960s.</p>
         <p> 	Bernard Geis Associates, a maverick publishing house, found great success with Brown's book, a guide to living single "in superlative style." It later published the wildly successful potboilers of Jacqueline Susann. <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title>, an advice manual that exhorted women to remain single and find fulfillment in an occupation and non-marital relationships with men, sparked national controversy and remained on the best-seller lists for months. Helen Gurley Brown made frequent personal, television, and radio appearances to promote the book. Rights to the title were sold to Warner Brothers at the highest price then ever paid for a non-fiction title. The film, <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title> (1964), starred Natalie Wood (as Helen Gurley Brown) and Tony Curtis.</p>
         <p> 	Following the success of <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title>, David Brown and Bernard Geis Associates marketed Helen in a variety of enterprises. She wrote a syndicated newspaper advice column, recorded phonograph albums and radio spots, and wrote prodigiously. Her next book, <title render="italic">Sex and the Office</title> (1964), a racier advice manual and expose of a sex-filled world of secretaries, sold disappointingly in comparison to <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title>.</p>
         <p> 	The Browns submitted proposals for a variety of works to keep up the momentum of Helen's popularity following <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title>: plays, television shows, other books, and magazines. Their proposal for a magazine for single women ("Femme") drew the interest of the Hearst magazine corporation. Though they did not want to start a new magazine for Brown, they made a trial agreement for her to try her format at their failing general interest magazine, <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>. Brown officially became editor of <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> in July 1965, and she brought dramatic changes to the first issue.</p>
         <p> 	Brown converted the conservative <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> to a female counterpart of Hugh Hefner's iconic <title render="italic">Playboy</title> magazine. She featured sexy cover models, controversial subject matter, and a hip sensibility that garnered a large audience quickly. While editing <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>, Helen Gurley Brown authored <title render="italic">The Single Girl's Cookbook</title> (1969) and <title render="italic">Sex and the New Single Girl</title> (1971), continued to be a guest on many TV shows, and became one of Hearst's biggest success stories. Meanwhile, David Brown, along with partner Richard Zanuck, produced many successful films, including <title render="italic">The Sting, Jaws, Cocoon, Deep Impact,</title> and <title render="italic">Chocolat</title>.</p>
         <p> 	In 1983 Helen wrote the best-seller <title render="italic">Having it All</title>, an advice manual and memoir in the style of <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title>. In the 1980s, she also had television stints as a regular on <title render="italic">Good Morning America</title>, a short-lived syndicated show <title render="italic">A View from Cosmo</title>, and was a guest on talk shows. She continued to edit the highly successful <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>, which had by the 1980s grown to 300 pages, of which a hundred were highly lucrative advertisements. She oversaw expansion of the <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> franchise into numerous international editions. In 1993 she wrote <title render="italic">The Late Show</title>, an advice manual and memoir about growing older. She published a writing guide, <title render="italic">The Writer's Rules</title>, in 1999, and in 2000 wrote her definitive memoir, <title render="italic">I'm Wild Again</title>.</p>
         <p> 	Brown's career was often marked by controversy. <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title>, a celebration of independent womanhood published a year before Betty Friedan's <title render="italic">The Feminine Mystique</title>, sparked much dispute about women's place in pre-women's movement popular culture. In a literary world that had only recently seen the lessening of stringent restrictions on the portrayal of sex, Brown's emphasis on sex drew much opposition from conservative critics. However, by the late 1960s, she and her vision of adamantly man-crazy womanhood drew opposition from non-conservatives as well. The incipient women's movement targeted Brown's limited vision of liberation. Feminists criticized the sex-object "Cosmo Girl" and envisioned a mass media that reflected a greater range of possibilities for women than the pink collar, man-obsessed vision of <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>. Brown's idiosyncratic notions of liberation and sexual freedom raised controversy in later years as well. In the 1990s, her dismissal of sexual harassment as a significant workplace problem and her indifference to the risk of AIDS for heterosexual women drew great wrath again from feminists. Brown nonetheless identified herself and her magazine as unfailingly feminist. She worked on behalf of the National Abortion Rights Action League in support of abortion rights and supported other feminist organizations and causes. </p>
         <p> While Brown was frequently the target of criticism, in the last years of her life she also accumulated accolades. Her work at <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> was recognized through her election to the Publishing Hall of Fame and a Henry Johnson Fisher Award. She was declared a New York City landmark, being a familiar presence on New York City busses heading from her Central Park West apartment to the <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> office. Her admirers and friends included gossip columnist Liz Smith, television journalist Barbara Walters, mogul Malcolm Forbes, and New York Mayor Ed Koch.</p>
         <p> In 1997 Brown gave up her editorship of <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> to become editor-in-chief of international editions of the magazine. Far from a retiree, she remained a workaholic in her new job, enjoyed travel with David, who continued to produce hit films until his death in 2010, and still voiced "outrageous" opinions that made her a frequent presence in newspapers and magazines. In early 2012 she established the David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation, donating $30 million dollars to collaborating institutions, Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and Stanford School of Engineering. Helen Gurley Brown died in a Manhattan hospital on 13 August 2012.</p>

    Helen Gurley Brown has been a pivotal figure in the magazine world in the second half of the twentieth century, and her papers give an insider's look into the Hearst organization, one of the most powerful media organizations of this century, and the publishing industry in general. The papers also address topics well beyond the world of magazines. Her work as an advertising copywriter at a time when women were not expected to work outside of the home certainly deserves consideration, and her call for "liberation" of the single woman was among the first. Brown's rags to riches career was unusual at a time when most women still did not work outside the home. Her experience of moving from pink-collar clerical worker to wealthy doyenne of the mass media was unique. She helped shape the popular culture of the 1960s and beyond. <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title> ushered in a spate of "Sex and the..." imitators but also launched a cultural dialogue on the question of the unmarried, sexually active, employed woman. The look of Cosmopolitan, which was conveyed on the signature covers photographed by Francesco Scavullo and the racy cover blurbs, defined young women's magazines for much of the second half of the twentieth century. As her career progressed, Brown associated with rich and influential people, who are well-represented in her collection. Additionally, the strong responses, both positive and negative, elicited by Brown's work give a sense of changing and conflicting public opinion on questions of sex, gender, and the media.</p>

The <title render="bold">Memorabilia</title> is especially engaging, containing writings and ephemera from her years in Little Rock and those pre-dating <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title>. The Papers contain a large selection of <title render="bold">Photographs</title>, some shot by celebrity photographers, and many with celebrity friends.</p>

               <p>Brown was always a prodigious correspondent. Her correspondence is organized into several subseries. The <title render="bold">Individuals</title> subseries is arranged alphabetically by name and includes friends, frequent correspondents, and correspondence more personal than businesslike. Accordingly correspondence can be found here that is related to her work at <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>, her writings, speeches and appearances, or other topics located elsewhere in her papers. Correspondence with celebrities is filed in <title render="bold">Individuals</title>.</p>
               <p> 	The next subseries is <title render="bold">Thank you and congratulatory notes</title>, mostly from her staff at <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> magazine, but also from her household staff and employers at Hearst. This correspondence is mainly of a quotidian nature, but illustrates how Brown, by many accounts a demanding person, earned the respect of her staff and employers.</p>
               <p> 	
                  <title render="bold">Public response and fan mail</title> includes letters from readers of Brown's writings and viewers of her appearances. Some letters are simple requests for autographs, while others provide detailed and moving accounts of how Brown's plan for success helped these generally working-class women find degrees of fulfillment. The extent to which these women embraced <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>'s message is in sharp contrast to the criticism leveled at the magazine by many conservatives and feminists.</p>
               <p> 	Correspondence by <title render="bold">Subject</title> includes letters generated by Brown's philanthropic work, critiques of magazines other than <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> and other Hearst properties, letters from libraries and museums interested in Brown's work, love letters from the 1950s, and correspondence with friends from Little Rock. The bulk of the <title render="bold">Subject</title> correspondence involves Editor's perquisites/gifts. These letters reveal Brown's personal interest in clothes and cosmetics. Noted for her thrift, she often used her clout as an editor of a women's magazine to obtain these items wholesale. Manufacturers and designers, eager to have their products highlighted in <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>, and others because they were friends, obliged. These letters give no indication that the products were intended for the pages of <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>; such correspondence can be found in SERIES V. <title render="italic">COSMOPOLITAN</title>. As best as can be determined, the letters here pertain to gifts and perquisites that were for Brown's personal use.</p>
               <p> 	
                  <title render="bold">General</title> correspondence contains letters of a quotidian nature, regarding home repairs and so forth.</p>
               <p> 	This series contains most of Brown's correspondence, but there is additional correspondence in other series. For example, correspondence generated by the planning and execution of speeches and appearances, with publishers and media figures interested in Helen's writings, and tied explicitly to her work at <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> can be found in the relevant series. Correspondence connected to specific projects has been kept with the project whenever possible. An exception to this rule is celebrity correspondence, which has been filed in SERIES II. CORRESPONDENCE-<title render="bold">Individuals</title> even though it may relate to a specific project. Determining whether or not correspondence should be categorized as professional or personal was one of the biggest challenges of this collection, since Brown's work and personal life were enmeshed. Many of the people with whom she maintained friendships were figures in the media. In general, the correspondence included in SERIES V. <title render="italic">COSMOPOLITAN</title> is explicitly related to the production of the magazine. Nonetheless, many of the correspondents in SERIES II. CORRESPONDENCE are at least tangentially related to <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>.</p>

               <p>Material in this series pertains to Brown's presentations in person, or on television or radio. There are correspondence; speech texts; and notes from her personal appearances, including the text of a debate in which she participated at Oxford University. Her television and radio work generated scripts; schedules; and correspondence, including public response mail from an appearance on the news program <title render="italic">Dateline</title>. Pilot shows starring Brown, one in the 1960s called <title render="italic">Outrageous Opinions</title> and another in the 1980s called <title render="italic">What Should I Do?</title>, generated material as well. Television proposals that never came to fruition are filed in SERIES IV. WRITINGS. In the early 1960s, Brown recorded a radio show that was syndicated in Canada. This series contains the complete scripts of these recordings.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Besides editing <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>, Helen Gurley Brown occupied herself primarily as a writer. Before she wrote the best-selling <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title>, she wrote ad copy, of which a small amount can be found here, and unpublished vignettes and poems. The emphasis on themes of sexuality and independent womanhood is greater in these early unpublished writings than her later published works.</p>
               <p> 	Brown's collection boasts impressive documentation of her published writing efforts. It contains drafts; manuscripts; newspaper clippings; and published copies of <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl, Sex and the Office, Outrageous Opinions, Having It All, The Late Show,</title> and <title render="italic">I'm Wild Again</title>. Researchers interested in her first two books should consult correspondence (filed in this series) with her publisher Bernard Geis Associates, which includes letters from Bernard Geis and Letty Cottin Pogrebin, and the Lucy Kroll Agency. This correspondence gives an excellent sense of the circumstances that surrounded Brown's sudden rise to fame and the successful efforts of Helen and David Brown to capitalize upon that fame. The correspondence also elucidates the changing world of the media and publishing in the 1960s as well as relatively new strategies of marketing controversial and sexually explicit material. Clippings record the public response to such efforts.</p>
               <p> 	There are published and draft versions of Brown's magazine and newspaper articles in this series. Material related to a syndicated advice column for single women that ran between the time <title render="italic">Sex and the Single Girl</title> was published and the point at which Brown took over <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> is of special interest. The series also contains the scripts and LP albums Brown recorded, one an album of advice, the other a recording of a speech. Short pieces that Brown wrote for other people's books and articles and her declines of such requests are found here.</p>
               <p> 	The unpublished material reveals the breadth of Brown's ideas. Several proposals for unrealized television programs, plays, and articles concern themes that Brown repeated in her published work, but take a more radical approach to them. Fragments of an incomplete autobiography; an autobiographical theatrical piece, which includes an audio-taped interview; and fictional short stories and poems are included among the unpublished works.</p>
               <p> 	The series also contains letters to the editor, notes, and some writings by David Brown.</p>

               <p>Helen Gurley Brown's "child" for more than four decades was <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> magazine. She changed a failing general interest magazine into a phenomenon-not only a best-selling magazine, but a cultural icon.</p>
               <p> 	This series comprehensively traces Brown's <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> career from its beginnings to her final job evaluating <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>'s international editions. Of special note is the proposal circulated by David and Helen Brown for a new magazine, "Femme," that would become <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>'s new format.</p>
               <p> 	Throughout her tenure, a primary component of Brown's job was the courting of advertisers. Texts of the speeches and presentations she gave to advertisers and international editorial staff, as well as acceptance speeches for awards given to <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> can be found in the subseries <title render="bold">Advertising and publicity</title>. This subseries includes advertisements for the magazine, including many written by Brown; promotional materials from the Hearst Corporation; and a large amount of newspaper clippings documenting coverage of <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> in the press.</p>
               <p> 	
                  <title render="bold">Correspondence</title> (the years 1988-89 are especially well documented) illuminates the day-to-day operations of Brown's editorial work, as letters flowed between Brown and writers, <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> staffers, advertisers, and Hearst executives regarding specific issues of the magazine as well as ongoing concerns. Frequent correspondents among the staff and Hearst executives are filed by individual. Researchers interested in the advertising content of the magazine may wish to consult the letters of Stan Perkins and Seth Hoyt. </p>
               <p> 	The <title render="bold">Editorial</title> subseries provides an in-depth look at the magazine production process. Rules for writing and art format, which Brown enforced strictly, are compiled from the 1970s to the 90s. There are files of article ideas and editing memos, and a sample folder that represents the transformation of an article from its submitted state to the published version. Some notes on Brown's ideas for the magazine have been included, as is information on production and circulation. This subseries also contains the results of reader and staff surveys. Within the <title render="bold">Editorial</title> material is a section on special features. Material regarding the famous Burt Reynolds centerfold and other special issues of the magazine, such as anniversary issues and the last issue edited by Helen Gurley Brown, are filed here. Another special feature was the failed television pilot <title render="italic">A View from Cosmo</title> starring Brown. A "Best of" set of articles has Brown's favorite article among pieces from such regular <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> writers as Erica Jong, Judith Krantz, and Gail Sheehy; a collection of some of Brown's long-running editorial, "Step into My Parlor;" and drafts and a copy of the only article Brown wrote for the magazine.</p>
               <p> 	A small subseries concerns <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> 
                  <title render="bold">Events</title> and includes material from a lunch given by Brown for other women's magazine editors to raise awareness for the National Abortion Rights Action League and a party thrown by the Hearst organization to celebrate Brown's twenty-fifth anniversary as Editor.</p>
               <p> 	A set of <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title> magazines from 1953-79 is housed in the Sophia Smith Collection's Periodicals Collection.</p>
