         <p>Mari Jo Buhle earned her B.A. from the University of Illinois-Champaign-Urbana in 1966, her M.A. from the University of Connecticut in 1968, and her PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1974.

Buhle's own research began with a specialty in the history of American radicalism and expanded to include the history of the behavior sciences in the United States.
