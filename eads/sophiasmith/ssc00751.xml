         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Founded in 1996 by a group of social scientists and practicioners, the Council on Contemporary Families is a think tank that counters conservative narratives and policies on the family. Its mission is to enhance public understanding of modern families. When its founders were in the early stages of forming the organization, there was debate as to whether it would be an advocacy and activist organization for families, or a think tank on the family. The organization is now made up of academics and other professionals. It hosts annual conferences and publishes papers and weekly news briefings.</p>
