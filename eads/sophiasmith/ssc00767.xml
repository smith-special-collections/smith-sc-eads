         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Helen Alling Davis served in many capacities over her career with the YWCA, including a period of traveling to Asia to establish the organization there. She was born in Dunkirk, New York, the daughter of Oscar B. Davis and Frances Freeman Bement. After graduating from Wellesley College, she began working at what was then the Women's Christian Association of Rochester, New York. In 1906, that organization became affiliated with the YWCA and Davis began working as Executive Director for the Northeastern Field Office in 1909. In 1913, she joined the YWCA National Board as Executive Director of the Field Work Division. Ten years later, Davis became Associate General Secretary of the YWCA-USA, a position she held for the next eight years. In 1930, she moved to California, ending her career there as the director of the YWCA's Asilomar Conference Center. During her career she spent a significant period of time Davis spent in the Philippines where she was working to establish the YWCA there. She retired in 1934.</p>
