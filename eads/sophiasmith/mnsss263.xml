         <p>Jean Leach was born in Bellaire, Ohio on October 2, 1911. She received a BS from Ohio State University in 1933 and a MSW from the Smith College School for Social Work in 1936. She was employed as caseworker, supervisor and casework director of Family Service of the Cincinnati Area from 1936-78. She served as a member of the Research Faculty and as Instructor of Administration in the Program of Advanced Study at the Smith College School for Social Work from 1957-64. She has been in private practice in Cincinnati from 1978 to the present. She has also worked as a consultant to the Olympus Center and to the Marjorie Lee Home for the Aged, both in Cincinnati, and to the Junior League of Cincinnati. In addition to regular employment, Leach also supervised the Cincinnati Family Service Staff in researching "Classification of Disorganized Families," under the auspices of Community Research Associates in New York, in 1955-56. She supervised the same group again in 1957-58 when they conducted research on "Motivation, Capacity and Opportunity," under the auspices of the University of Chicago Research Center. From 1978-80, she was a member of the Committee of Eighteen, Cincinnati, for the National Council of Churches' Child and Family Justice Project. Jean Leach has served on the Boards of several Cincinnati-area social service agencies and has also been active in professional associations, including the Family Service Association of America, the Ohio Society of Clinical Social Workers, and the National Association of Social Workers. Jean Leach continued to see clients until age 94. She died on Jan 6, 2009.</p>
