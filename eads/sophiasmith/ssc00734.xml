         <p>Women's Interfaith Institute (WII) was founded in 1992 as a support network for clergywomen in the Berkshires of Western Massachusetts by Yale Divinity School graduate Reverend Allison Stokes. Under its founding name, Clergywomen's Interfaith Institute, the organization sought to to provide continuing education and resources to clergywomen and lay religious leaders of small congregations of multiple faiths. In addition to sponsoring annual Harvest Festivals, the group created an archive and lending library containing information on work by women "engaged in ministry" in the region, as well as materials on women in religion and feminist theology. In order to be more inclusive, the organization changed its name to Women's Interfaith Institute in 1995 and expanded its membership to include "women of spirit." When Allison Stokes moved to the Finger Lakes region of New York in 2002, she founded the separately incorporated affiliate organization, Women's Interfaith Intstitute in the Finger Lakes (NY). With the formation of the Finger Lakes affiliate, the Berkshires group became known as the Women's Interfaith Institute in the Berkshires (MA). In 2003, the Finger Lakes group purchased a historic church building next to the Women's Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls, New York.</p>
