         <p>1917, Russian women within the Kerensky Provisional Government invited the YWCA to help working women, recently granted full civil rights, to prepare themselves for their new role in society. Taylor, who at the time was industrial secretary for the YWCA's regional offices in Minneapolis, and seven other women travelled to Russia and established Y associations in Petrograd and in Moscow and worked with women's groups in other cities. They also operated a shipboard exhibition along the Volga River in 1918, demonstrating improved nutrition, child care, and agricultural techniques to villagers. The combination of political upheavals as the Bolsheviks seized control, the threat of German invasion after March 1918, and Allied intervention in northern Russia in support of the anti-Bolsheviks led to the evacuation of all Americans from the Bolshevik-controlled portions of the country. The YWCA women left the country briefly but made their way back to northern Russia set up box-car canteens for U.S. troops in Archangel before finally returning to the US in conjunction with Allied Forces withdrawal in 1919.</p>
