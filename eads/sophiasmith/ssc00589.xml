         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>WomenArts is a non-profit arts service organization dedicated to helping women artists get the resources they need to do their creative work. Created in 1994 by Martha Richards, the organization has raised over $4 million and created a website that provides free networking, fundraising and advocacy services to over 500,000 visitors a year. Originally called the Fund for Women Artists, it was based in Northampton, Massachusetts from 1994 to 2007. It moved to San Francisco, California in August 2007 and was renamed WomenArts in 2011. WomenArts seeks to challenge gender and other stereotypes by supporting the creation and appreciation of art that reflects the full diversity and complexity of women's lives, and to advocate for women artists to be paid fairly and to have more opportunities to make a living from their creative work.</p>

         <p>The WomenArts records consist of grant applications, funding proposals, financial information, reports, and publicity materials for the parent organization, as well as for projects and artists that WomenArts funded. The records focus on organizations and individual artists, primarily women and organizations run by women, located in Western Massachusetts, including the Chrysalis Theatre, the Enchanted Forest Theatre, the Sleeveless Theatre, and the Massachusetts International Festival of the Arts; and local playwrights and actors, including Deborah Lubar and Andrea Hairston among others. The WomenArts Records provide good documentation of how local artists and arts organizations sought funding from public and private sources.</p>
