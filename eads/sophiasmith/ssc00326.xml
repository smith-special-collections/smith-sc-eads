         <p>The records of the International Women's Writing Guild include correspondence, conference material, newsletters, programs, flyers, brochures, pamphlets, monographs, documents pertaining to the work of IWWG members a directory of playwrights, a volume documenting the life of Banjo Clarke, and published books. The conference "The Diary, the Journal, the Autobiography" is particularly well-documented. There is a fairly complete run of the organization's newsletters, as well as the 10th annual yearbook and a copy of the play ""Of Two Minds", developed for the Women's Writing Conference held at Goucher College in 1977. Extensive documentation of the Artist of Life Award, an IWWG program that recognizes women over age sixty who have made a significant change of lifestyle in the third segment of their lives, is also included.</p>
