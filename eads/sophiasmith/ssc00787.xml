         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Founded in the early 1970s by several women dissatisfied with the sexist treatment they received as members of the Union of Radical Political Economists, the Marxist-Feminist Group reflected the radical politics and increasingly radical feminism of its founders. The vast majority were young white academics, graduate students or junior faculty, who met twice or so a year, exchanging papers, discussing recent publications while all the while supporting each other as Marxist feminists. Known to themselves as M-F 1, M-F 2 and M-F 3 (the New Haven, Boston and New York City groups), fearing red-baiting, the group's public name was the Northeastern Feminist Women's Conference. According to historian Sara Evans,"the membership lists of the Marxist-feminist discussion groups reads like a who's who of feminist scholarship,"including Linda Gordon, Alice Kessler-Harris, Blanche Wiesen Cook, and Joan Kelly ("Tidal Wave: How Women Changed America at Century's End,"p. 165).</p>
