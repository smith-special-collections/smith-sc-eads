         <abstract id="aspace_7899c1bb2ee74419b12c5d545a112073">Elizabeth Healy Ross was a psychiatric social worker. Her work with the U.S. government during World War II led to social work services for military personnel becoming an integral part of all branches of the armed services. Her papers include materials related to her work with the armed forces and the District of Columbia, as well as her employment at the Bank Street School of Education and her involvement in professional associations. There are small amounts of material pertaining to Ross's husband, Michael Ross, and to her daughter, Mary Ross.</abstract>
