         <p>Evelyn Corliss White was born in Chicago in 1954 to Amanda Cantrells and Andrew S. White. Her siblings are Andrew White, Jr., Antoine White, Angelo White, and Phyllis A. White.

Returning to the United States, she studied theatre at the University of Washington and began writing professionally while living in Seattle. She graduated from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1985, where she received the Christopher Trump Award for her Master's thesis on "The Racial Development of Blind Black Children."
