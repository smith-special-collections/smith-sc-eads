         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Tribad Productions was an all-women's theatrical company that produced plays written by women, for women. It was open to all women and was comprised primarily of lesbians. Both its producer, Judy De Rosa, and its artistic director, Tiana Lee, lived in the Russian River Valley town of Guerneville, California, a "thriving center for all forms of lively, artistic expressions." The majority of the Tribad company were local amateurs from surrounding communities, and the plays were performed at a community theater in Guerneville, always to a packed house. Tribad sponsored a play-writing contest in late 1992, the winner of which received a $250 cash prize. The company folded in 1995.</p>
