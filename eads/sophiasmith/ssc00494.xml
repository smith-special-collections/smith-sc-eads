         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Clare Millicent Coss, lesbian feminist, playwright and psychotherapist, had her feminist awakening in the late 1960's. Soon thereafter she began writing plays with political, feminist themes, and her first work, <title render="italic">Titty Titty Bang Bang</title>, was published circa 1971. Coss has since published numerous plays and other works. She founded Women's Experimental Theatre in New York City in the 1970s. She also edited <title render="italic">Lillian D. Wald, Progressive Activist</title> (1989), <title render="italic">The Blessing</title>, a new play (1988), and <title render="italic">The Arc of Love: An Anthology of Lesbian Love Poems</title> (1996). In the words of freelance writer Judith Pasternak, she"may be the only working playwright in the U.S. who earns her living as a psychotherapist." In Coss's own words, "...feminism strengthens me, informs my work as a psychotherapist and playwright, [and] gives me the gifts of love, activism and community....". She lives in New York City and is partner of Blanche Wiesen Cook.</p>
