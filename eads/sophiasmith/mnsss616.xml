         <p>Born in Chicago, Rosemary Keefe Curb received her BA in Biology from Rosary College, part of Dominican University in Illinois in 1962. As Sister Mary Geralda, O.P., she taught high school biology, religion, and English courses until 1965 when she left the order, married (later divorced) and returned to school. She then went on to earn a Master's degree in English and eventually her PhD in English from the University of Arkansas in 1977. For the next thirty years, Keefe taught English and Women's Studies, including at Rollins College, where she also served as Director of Women's Studies (1979-1992) and at the University of Wisconsin-Superior, 2000-2007. Her dissertation was on"The American Dream in Afro-American Drama: 1960-1970."She entered the field of Women's Studies just as it was developing and was a prolific scholar whose research focused primarily on feminist and/or lesbian theater. The author of several articles, Keefe is co-editor of"Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence"(1985) and editor of"Amazon All Stars: Thirteen Lesbian Plays"(1996).</p>
