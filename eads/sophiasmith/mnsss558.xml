As the Guttmacher Institute website states, 'Good reproductive health policy starts with credible research'; indeed, the Institute's records provide accurate and accessible research from a wide range of sexual and reproductive health fields. Records include reports, data, publications, administrative and financial records, some correspondence. They also include the papers of Jacqueline E. Darroch, Senior Fellow of the AGI and co-author of over 100 publications related to sexual and reproductive health since her involvement with the Institute in 1978. The collection also contains the papers of Christopher Tietze, physician and celebrated researcher of abortion and contraception. [NOTE: All contents list for this collection are not online.

         <p>The Alan Guttmacher Insitute (AGI) is a research institution dedicated to the production and dissemination of sexual and reproductive health research. The AGI was founded in 1968 as the Center for Family Planning Program Development, a department of the Planned Parenthood Federation of American (PPFA). The Center had as its champion Alan F. Guttmacher, the prestigious obstetrician/gynecologist/educator who served as PPFA president for more than ten years until his death in 1974. By 1977, the Center was renamed the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) in Dr. Guttmacher's honor and incorporated as an independent non-profit organization with its own Board of Directors, distinct from PPFA. But its mission and goals remain the same since its founding. As stated on their Web site, "The Guttmacher Institute advances sexual and reproductive health and rights through an interrelated program of research, policy analysis and public education designed to generate new ideas, encourage enlightened public debate and promote sound policy and program development. The Institute's overarching goal is to ensure the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health for all people worldwide." To that end, AGI maintains an impressive Web site, making widely available the facts and figures of their quantitive and qualitative research published in a range of journals  published in a range of journals as well as accessible summaries that highlight the findings of their extensive studies.

                  <p>Managed Care: The Alan Guttmacher Institute's project Mainstreaming Family Planning in Managed Care aims to document and evaluate how well managed care serves the contraceptive needs of American women, especially those who are poor. The Survey of Women will involve a telephone survey of 1,000 women enrolled in managed care plans across five states.</p>
                  <p>Opening Doors: Low-income and minority women have greater difficulties than other women in avoiding unplanned pregnancy; in part, this reflect lower levels of contraceptive use and higher likelihood of contraceptive failure. However, it is not clear whether racial and ethnic
differences simply represent the greater socioeconomic disadvantage of black and Hispanic women or if they result from other characteristics of or barriers faced by these women. This study sought to learn directly from low-income women about their perceptions of and experiences with contraceptive methods and contraceptive service providers. Using that information, a further goal of this project was to inform policymakers and those providing contraceptive and other reproductive health information and services to women about how they might better meet the needs of low-income women and minority-group women. The key objective of this project was to document the attitudes and experiences of
low-income women and minority women with regard to obtaining contraceptive information and services and effectively using available contraceptives.</p>

                  <p>"The ultimate goal of this project is to increase women's access to safe abortion services, by compelling decision-makers to act by generating the political will to make abortion safe, legal, and available. The project's specific objectives are:</p>
                  <p>Increase the quality and quantity of accurate high-priority information on abortion care available to policymakers and key stakeholders through research, the publication of a global chartbook, at least two journal articles and a range of communications products (fact sheets, policy briefs, PowerPoint presentations, etc.) in order to advance evidence-based discussions and policies; and through assessment of knowledge gaps and research needs in the Buffett Foundation's 11 priority countries leading to preparation and submission of proposals to address identified high priority questions and issues.
    Communicate/disseminate findings and materials to global, regional, and local audiences to reinvigorate policy discussions on clandestine abortion and advance evidence-based policies at all levels.
    
Project components: The monograph included a literature review of the past 10 years of evidence about the safety of abortions and included analysis of Guttmacher's AICM projects in select countries that had recent project activity including: Guatemala, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Mexico."</p>

                  <p>Principal Investigator: Jennifer Frost, Dr. P.H.</p>
                  <p>Project Description: "As part of The California Wellness Foundation's (TCWF's) Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Initiative, the Alan Guttmacher Institute is undertaking an investigation into issues surrounding teenage childbearing in California. Key questions that underlie this project include: Why do so many adolescents become pregnant and why do those who do so accidentally (the great majority) carry their pregnancy to term rather than have an abortion? What can be done to emphasize preventive behavior, what services are available to assist teens facing a pregnancy; and what factors, life circumstances and parental, peer or partner pressures are involved when teens decide to carry a pregnancy to term?"</p>

                  <p>"The March of Dimes (MOD) and The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) have agreed to seek funding for a national project on availability, accessibility and use of prenatal care. A proposal will be prepared during 1991, submitted to foundations and/or the March of Dimes grants committee, with the expectation that if funds can be raised for this project, work will begin in early 1992. </p>
                  <p>The national project would have two main components: the collection of county level data on availability and accessibility of prenatal care and possibly of health care for children under age two. This information would be collected by MOD chapters, under the supervision of their national and regional staff, and with technical assistance from the AGI. MOD chapter staff and/or volunteers would survey providers using questionnaires and procedures designed by the AGI in consultation with the MOD. The AGI would be responsible for checking, editing, coding and keypunching survey questionnaires, for creating a clean computer file for analysis and for producing detailed tabulations.
"-the compilation of new data on use of prenatal care services, similar to those published in the recent Institution publication: Prenatal Care in the United States: a State and County Inventory. This requires acquiring and processing detailed vital statistics files for 1987, 1988 and 1989. County level tabulations would be produced and analyzed."</p>

                  <p>"Goal: The goal of this project is to contribute to the improvement of contraceptive use and the reduction of unintended pregnancy in the United States. To achieve this goal, the project focuses on three interrelated objectives:
1) "To provide a comprehensive, national frame of reference or "map" of key factors contributing to poor contraceptive use from women's perspectives, by surveying a national sample of sexually active women at risk for unintended pregnancy. This information will enable us to assess the relative importance and priority of these factors based on their contribution to women's difficulties in using contraception effectively."
2) "To match this map with information on contraceptive delivery practices in order to identify changes that have the greatest potential to reduce unintended pregnancy, by collecting data from a national sample of publicly funded family planning clinics and private doctors."
3) "To identify policy and programmatic implications and make concrete recommendations for next steps in service delivery and research that will help move knowledge into practice so as to reduce unintended pregnancy in the United States."</p>

                  <p>From the Project Description:
"Contraceptive Coverage in the Age of Managed Care (1998–1999)
With this one-year project, AGI will bring the best information to bear on the issue of access to contraceptive services and supplies through private insurance. The Institute will:
 1) Assess issues and information from existing research that have the potential to enlist the support of diverse groups for the expansion of contraceptive coverage and explore remaining questions and possible areas of contention;
 2) Synthesize and simplify existing research findings in a variety of public education materials; and raise awareness of the issues involved through dissemination, Web site posting and presentations to professional groups, organizations, opinion leaders and media selected for their ability to influence managed care organizations and consumers;
 3) Monitor major state and federal policy developments which would ensure coverage of the full range of contraceptive options for women covered by private insurance."
 
"Contraceptive Coverage in Private-sector Insurance Plans (1999–)
 1) To mobilize support for contraceptive insurance coverage within the private-sector, AGI will assemble and work with a task force composed of a diverse group of key employers and employee benefits managers; labor union negotiators; large employers, insurers and managed care plans.
 2) In doing so, the Institute will identify arguments that may resonate with employers, insurers and managed care plans in order to persuade them to provide contraceptive coverage and messages that may convince labor unions and employee associations that contraceptive coverage is a vital component of employee health benefits and should be a priority in benefit-related contract negotiations with employers.
 3) "Finally, AGI will develop and widely disseminate a comprehensive action plan for private sector-focused activities—including funding needs for such a plan—and begin reaching out to key commercial audiences with research and policy analysis from AGI and others on women's contraceptive needs, the limitations of current coverage and the benefits of coverage that is comprehensive.</p>
                  <p>"Contraceptive Coverage in Private-sector Insurance Plans (2001–)
 1) AGI has undertaken a series of activities to ensure that contraceptives are affordable to all Americans. First, the Institute convened a working group—representing labor, business, women's and reproductive health organizations—to refine and adapt persuasive
arguments (developed last year through AGI's contacts with business and insurance leaders) for the expansion of contraception in the private sector. The group is working to identify and involve new organizations and individuals that might be influential in the policy debate. This year, AGI will begin developing a methodology to quantify the costs and benefits of covering contraception in private insurance plans, to provide employers with a complete economic model they may consult in making coverage decisions.
 2) AGI is also examining employer-based health plans to map trends, monitor the needs of the uninsured and document options for those without coverage. AGI is building on its accomplishments in advancing contraceptive coverage in the public sector by making
staff expertise available to policymakers and activists who are working toward passage of the federal Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act and similar initiatives at the state level.
 3) Last year, AGI began an update of its 1998 study to ascertain the coverage of reproductive health services, contraception and abortion within private insurance plans overall. This information helped spur state actions to mandate contraceptive coverage in private insurance plans (13 states to date). Upon publication, the findings will be used to inform new efforts aimed at meeting Americans' needs for services."</p>

                  <p>"Implementation of Congressional restrictions terminating federal funding for abortion except when necessary to save the life of the woman represents an extremely significant shift in U.S. public health policy. It has created an almost ideal laboratory for studying the consequences for both individuals and society of restricting access to abortion. The only previous case of such restriction occurred in Rumania in 1966. Michael S. Teitelbaum's study is now the classic
reference concerning its impact on subsequent fertility, supplemented by Nicholas H. Wright's study of effects on maternal and child health. Since the restriction potentially affected every woman and no alternative means of fertility control were readily available, the analysis of Rumanian experience was comparatively simple. While the current U.S. situation is fraught with
complexity, it nonetheless provides a rare opportunity to assess systematically the impact of such a policy change. The findings would be invaluable for both researchers and policymakers. It is therefore critical that evaluation efforts be planned and implemented without delay."</p>

                  <p>Final Article: Public Health Departments Providing Sexually Transmitted Disease Services
Authors: David J. Landry and Jacqueline E. Darroch
Published by the Guttmacher Institute in Family Planning Perspectives 1996 (now Perspectives on Sexual and
Reproductive Health).
Description of the Study: "This project will describe and assess the adequacy of the nation's publicly-funded
sexually transmitted disease (STD) diagnostic treatment services. Information will be obtained by mailed survey
from a nationally representative sample of publicly-funded agencies that provide STD services. The results
from the survey will be compared with a 1995 AGI [Alan Guttmacher Institute] survey of agencies providing
contraceptive services to identify gaps and overlaps between the STD and family planning service providers in
outreach, clients served, services provided and referral arrangements. The project is funded under a grant from
DHHS' Office of Population Affairs (OPA) through an interagency agreement with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. It is a component of a wide-reaching Alan Guttmacher Institute project, funded by
OPA, to reassess the nation's family planning and reproductive health needs."</p>

                  <p>Purpose:
"The purpose of the project is to examine how the fact of a pregnancy being unplanned affects the health of the baby at birth and during early infancy. It is assumed that any such influence operates through the effect of the planning status of the pregnancy on the mother's behavior, which is, in turn, a primary determinant of the baby's well-being. The underlying hypothesis is that the unintended conception is associated with less personal input to promote the baby's health both during pregnancy and after the baby is born…The investigation will evaluate the impact of unplanned pregnancy on women's behavior in two principal areas. The first consists of activities during pregnancy, and the second is care of the infant after birth. It is not possible, however, to identify and test the effects of planning status on all behaviors that could have a bearing on the health of the child. For this reason and because the ultimate significance of the mother's behavior lies in its close association with the health of her infant, the indirect relationships between planning status and measure of the baby's well-being will also be examined."</p>

                  <p>From the Funding Proposal to the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation:
"Summary:
The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) proposes to refocus and reorient attention on the problems of teenage sexual activity, pregnancy, abortion, and childbearing for the 1990s. To do so, AGI will collect and analyze the most recent information on these issues, synthesize the data, and present the findings, conclusions and recommendations in a new chartbook. Like its immediate predecessor, the Institute's 1981 Teenage Pregnancy: The Problem That Hasn't Gone Away, the updated version is intended to be a major source of information, presenting complicated research data in a simple and cohesive fashion and pointing to opportunities for policy and program action. With this publication, AGI will place teenage pregnancy within the larger context of what has been learned about adolescent and high-risk behavior in recent years as well as in the context of the concurrent increase in poverty, the decrease in services, the attacks on family planning programs, the growth of AIDS among adolescents, and the need for reproductive health services among young people. To enhance the chartbook's effectiveness, an extensive public education/outreach effort will be targeted to an audience of 5,000 policymakers, program planners, community leaders, activists, professionals working with youth and the press."</p>

                  <p>Christopher Tietze, a physician and respected authority on abortion, contraception, and pregnancy, began working for the Population Council in the 1970s. He authored several iterations of the report "Induced Abortion: A World Review." At the time of his death in 1984, Tietze was in the process of compiling the sixth edition of this fact book. The Guttmacher Institute undertook the completion of this project.</p>

                  <p>These files mostly consist of Tietze's correspondence and handwritten statistics sent to him by health officials around the world. What is particularly compelling about these files is that they represent the work that Tietze did in his final years, and the folder in Box 2 "1985 Abortion Fact Book" contains copies of the letters that he dictated on his last ever day in the office.</p>

Some of the files relate to a project "Five Year Plan Family Planning Study." The dates of the files in these two boxes seem to range from the 1970s through the late 1980s."</p>
                  <p>"Five Year Plan Family Planning Study" refers to multiple projects conducted for various organizations by the Guttmacher Institute, all iterations of the same core idea to study family planning through various lenses.</p>
