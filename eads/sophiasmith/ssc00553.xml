She graduated from Smith College in 1961, from the University of California at Berkeley in 1963 with an M.A. in English, and from the University of Minnesota in 1969 with a Ph.D. From 1969 to 1998 she was professor of English at Macalester College in Minnesota.

She has also written a series of books on England: My Love Affair with England (1992), England as You Like It (1995), England for All Seasons (1997), and Victoria, the Heart of England: A Journey of Discovery (1999). Her other books include Reading Rooms (1991) and A House of One's Own: An Architect's Guide to Designing the House of Your Dreams (1991), co-authored with her husband, architect James Stageberg. Toth's essays, stories and reviews have appeared in many newspapers and magazines across the United States.</p>
