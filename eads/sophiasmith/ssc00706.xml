After teaching in a parochial elementary school for a few years, Oates attended Catholic University of America from which she earned a B.A. in economics, summa cum laude, in 1963. She then went on to Yale University where she earned a Master's in economics in 1964 and a PhD in 1969. Her dissertation became the basis of her first book, <title render="italic">The Role of the Cotton Textile Industry in the Economic Development of the American Southeast: 1900-1940</title>(1975). She began her college teaching career in 1967 in the Department of Economics at Regis College in Weston, Massachusetts. She taught at Boston College from 1974 to 2005. Since the early 1970s, Oates'scholarship has focused on the study of women, especially Catholics, in American social and economic history. She is the author or editor of several books, including <title render="italic">Higher Education for Catholic Women: An Historical Anthology</title> (1987), ed., and <title render="italic">The Catholic Philanthropic Tradition in America</title> (1995).
