            <p>The Red Cross was founded in Washington, DC, by Clara Barton in 1881, following the Civil War, and provides services to members of the American armed forces and their families, as well as providing disaster relief in the United States and around the world. </p>
            <p>With the outbreak of WWI the organization experienced dramatic growth. The public contributed $400 million in funds and material to support Red Cross programs, including those for American and Allied
                forces and civilian refugees. The Red Cross staffed hospitals and ambulance companies and recruited 20,000 registered nurses to serve the military. After the war, the Red Cross focused on service to veterans and enhanced other programs. </p>
            <p>During Second World War the organization was called upon to provide extensive services once again to the U.S. military, Allies, and civilian war victims. They enrolled more than 104,000 nurses for military service, prepared 27 million packages for American and Allied prisoners of war, and shipped over 300,000 tons of supplies overseas. At the military's request, the Red Cross also initiated a national blood program that collected 13.3 million pints of blood
                for use by the armed forces.</p>
