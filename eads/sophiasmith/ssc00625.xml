         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Robert Schulman had a 70-year journalism career that encompassed print and broadcast reporting, writing, and commentary in three different regions of the country. Born in New York, he was a graduate of New York University and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. He served in the U.S. Air Corps and Air Transport Command from 1942-46 and  began his newspaper reporting career in St. Louis in 1937. Much later, Mr. Schulman published "Romany Marie: The Queen of Greenwich Village" in 2006. He died in 2008 at the age of 91.</p>
         <p>Romany Marie, nee Marie Marchand, was a Greenwich Village doyenne and restaurateur who played a key role in bohemianism in New York City from the early 1900s through the late 1950s. Her cafes and tearooms, more akin to salons, were warm and lively places, known for the dynamic interchange and pollination of ideas that took place there. They had an extensive following, especially among artists and literati, including Buckminster Fuller, Eugene O'Neill, Mary Garden, Muriel Draper, and sculptors Isamu Noguchi and David Smith. Romany Marie, who has been described as attractive and unusual, lively and generous, was a well known and beloved character who provided free meals to those who needed them. She was a former anarchist who had attended Emma Goldman meetings, although she later distanced herself from anarchism.</p>
