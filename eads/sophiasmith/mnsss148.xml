        Federation of America provide substantial information about the history of the birth control
        and family planning movement nationally and internationally. They are a significant source
        of information on all aspects of the history of birth control and family planning, including
        women's health issues; sex education; women in poverty; international population planning
        and policy; and the legal, political and social aspects of contraception and abortion. Types
        of material include correspondence; memoranda; minutes; reports; financial records; legal
        records; publicity; publications; photographs; audio tapes; video tapes; and posters. The
        PPFA Records are divided into two portions, PPFA I and PPFA II, this being section II. The
        earlier records in <extref href="mnsss128_main.html">PPFA I</extref> are completely
        organized and open to research. PPFA II consists of records received since 1988, dating from
        the 1920s to the present, so there is some overlap in dates. We apologize, but the finding aid to PPFAII 
        exceeds the capacities of this website (Asteria) to display. We are in the process of
        implementing a new system that will not have this limitation. As a temporary measure,

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>In 1921 Margaret Sanger founded the national lobbying organization, American Birth Control
        League (ABCL) which in 1942 became Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA). Between
        1921 and 1942 the organization underwent two transformations. In 1923 Sanger opened the
        Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau (BCCRB) for the purposes of dispensing contraceptives
        under the supervision of licensed physicians and studying their effectiveness. The ABCL
        provided institutional backing for clinics. The BCCRB merged with the ABCL in 1939 to form
        the Birth Control Federation of American (BCFA). In 1942 the name of the BCFA was changed to
        the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.</p>
         <p> The name change reflected a redefinition of the organization's goals from family
        limitation to family planning. While PPFA continued to function as the largest birth control
        organization in the country, it sought to position itself as a more mainstream and moderate
        organization committed to a broad range of programs related to reproductive health. Under
        the leadership of National Director D. Kenneth Rose, the PPFA expanded its programs and
        services through the 1940s, adding affiliate organizations throughout the country. By the
        end of World War II, the Federation was no longer solely a center for birth control services
        or a clearing house for contraceptive information but had emerged as a major national health
        organization. PPFA's programs included a full range of family planning services, including
        marriage education and counseling, and infertility services. The leadership of the PPFA,
        largely consisting of businessmen and male physicians, endeavored to incorporate its
        contraceptive services unofficially into regional and national public health programs by
        emphasizing less politicized aspects such as child-spacing. During the 1950s, the Federation
        further adjusted its programs and message to appeal to a family-centered, more conservative
        post-war populace, while continuing to function, through its affiliated clinics, as the most
        reliable source of contraceptives in the country.</p>
         <p> From 1942 to 1962, PPFA concentrated its efforts on strengthening its ties to affiliates,
        expanding public education programs, and improving its medical and research work. By 1960,
        visitors to PPFA centers across the nation numbered over 3,000,000 per year.</p>
         <p> In the 1950s PPFA began focusing greater attention on global population issues as new
        concerns arose over the political, social, and cultural implications of overpopulation in
        Asia and around the world. The organization became active in international birth control
        work through its membership in the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), which
        Margaret Sanger helped found in 1952. In 1961 the population crisis debate, along with
        funding shortages, convinced PPFA to merge with the World Population Emergency Campaign, a
        citizens' fund-raising organization, to become PPFA-World Population. Later in the 1960s,
        after several decades of emphasizing a family-centered, more conservative program for public
        health, PPFA reasserted its primary commitment to championing women's reproductive rights.
        It was also in the 1960s that family planning began to win the support of the federal
        government. Alan Guttmacher, M.D., who served as president of PPFA from 1962 until his death
        in 1974, was an effective advocate for the idea of a woman's right to safe and effective
        birth control. He successfully fought for the development of federally funded domestic and
        international family planning programs. Guttmacher also played an important role in the
        development of the birth control Pill and IUD. The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) was named
        in his honor. AGI is an independent corporation for research, policy analysis, and public
        education on reproductive health issues and is a special affiliate of PPFA.</p>
         <p> In 1970, Congress enacted Title X of the Public Health Services Act, providing support and
        funding for family planning services and educational programs and for biomedical and
        behavioral research in reproduction and contraceptive development. The Family Planning
        International Assistance division was established in 1972 by PPFA, becoming the largest U.S.
        nongovernmental provider of family planning services to developing countries.</p>
         <p> In 1978, Faye Wattleton was appointed the first woman president of PPFA since Margaret
        Sanger. She led PPFA in its ongoing battle to preserve access to safe and legal abortion, to
        protect client confidentiality, especially for minors, against encroachments by the state,
        and to preserve federal funding for domestic and international family planning programs. By
        the time she retired from PPFA in 1992, Wattleton had greatly expanded its program of
        advocacy around the idea that sexual and reproductive liberation is central to women's
        equality.</p>
         <p> In the 1980s and 90s, PPFA faced an onslaught of opposition to family planning and birth
        control. The organization challenged regulations passed under the administrations of
        Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush that placed restrictions on U.S. funding of family
        planning services overseas and domestically. Organized right-wing opposition and violence
        against birth control and abortion providers also became a serious concern. PPFA continues
        to confront this opposition while it also addresses the public health issues surrounding
        sexuality and reproduction, such as the AIDS epidemic and the effect of poverty on families
        and children. Gloria Feldt currently serves as president of Planned Parenthood.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The records of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America are divided into two groups
        based on when they were received by the Sophia Smith Collection: PPFA I was received prior
        to 1988, and PPFA II was received beginning in 1988. Although the time periods covered by
        the two groups overlaps, <extref href="mnsss128_main.html">PPFA I</extref> consists of the
        earlier records of the Federation (1918-74) and is completely organized and open to
        research. PPFA II consists of the central files of PPFA from the 1950s through 1981, with
        scattered earlier items dated as early as 1921. Miscellaneous accessions received from
        miscellaneous departments from 1988 through the 1990s are also included in a separate list
        following the central files. PPFA II records are unprocessed; the original order established
        by PPFA has been retained. For ease of access, restricted materials (1985 to the present and
        selected earlier records) have been segregated from those that are open to research (see
        Conditions Governing Access). The inventory lists both open and closed materials.</p>
         <p>These records document the work of PPFA nationally and internationally in the areas of
        advocacy; medical services and research; legislation; public relations; and the specific
        work of affiliates, departments, and committees. Types of materials include correspondence,
        reports, minutes, memos, publicity, publications and other printed material, audiotapes,
        reference files, and financial and legal material.</p>

               <p>We are in the process of implementing a new system that will not have this
