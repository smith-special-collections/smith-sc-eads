         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Theresa Carr was born in Chicago, the daughter of Vernon and Zola Strut Carr. She grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts and graduated from the town high school, with honors, in 1972. Carr went on to the University of Massachustts Amherst where, in addition to extensive political activities such as co-founding the Orchard Hill Women's Center and the Wounded Knee Support Committee, she earned her Bachelor's degree in Economics in just three years. As a self-proclaimed "Marxist-Leninist lesbian," she joined fellow dormitory residents in transforming the third floor of Dickinson Hall into the "Liberation Corridor." She went on, also at UMass, to earn a Master's degree in Labor Relations and Research, working as a union organizer in the Pioneer Valley. After graduation, Carr lived in Holyoke where she also worked as an apprentice carpenter. By the early 1980s, she moved to New Haven, Connecticut and became a licensed union carpenter in 1982. Throughout the 1980s, Carr continued her intense political activities, including co-founding the Spinsters Opposed to Nuclear Genocide (SONG) and the New Haven Coalition for Justice in El Salvador. She also protested against the United States' intervention in Nicaragua and for Puerto Rican independence; she volunteered at the New Haven Women's Liberation Center and organized neighborhood protests against inadequate city services; over the course of three decades, she was jailed many times as a result of her activism. Carr was also involved in the New England Women's Music scene and in the early 2000s was part of a women's land trust in the Florida Keys. A naturalist and Buddhist, Theresa Carr died after a two year battle against breast cancer. Her ashes were scattered the following year during the Seneca Women's Peace Encampment Reunion.</p>
