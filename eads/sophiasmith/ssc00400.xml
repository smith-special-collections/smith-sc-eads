Originally a Russian Studies major at Brown University in the 1960s, McGoldrick went on to the Smith College School for Social Work in 1969. In recognition of her contributions to the field of family therapy as a practitioner, as an instructor, and as an author, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Smith College in 1991.</p>
