         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Dorothy Pitman Hughes is a civil rights feminist activist, movement leader and author. Born in Lumpkin, Georgia in 1938, Pitman Hughes grew up in the segregated South, experiencing firsthand the violence of racism where, in 1948 her father was severely beaten by men her family believed to be members of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1957 she moved to New York City and during the 1960s worked as a salesperson, house cleaner, and nightclub singer while raising bail money for jailed civil rights activists. In the late 1960s, needing care for her own children (by 1970, she had three daughters) Pitman Hughes organized a multiracial cooperative day care center on the West Side which would be profiled by <title render="italic">New York Magazine</title> columnist, Gloria Steinem. The two women became friends and when Steinem began her public speaking career on behalf of feminism, she asked Pitman Hughes to join her. They went on to co-found Ms Magazine with other feminist writers and activists.</p>
