She was also diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1966. This collection consists primarily of her personal diaries, which are extraordinary both for their completeness and their candor about Waldron's life and feelings.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Carol Willis Talmage was born November 10, 1925 to Ila Hoag Talmage and Harry Talmage. She married Steven Waldron and with him had four children: Christopher (1945), Nicholas (1949), Deborah (1953), and Abigail (1956). She divorced Steven Waldron in 1971, became financially self-sufficient by learning to repair cars and taking in lodgers, among other things, and served as chair of the Lexington, Massachusetts branch of the National Organization for Women (NOW) in the 1970s. According to a 1977 legal document, Waldron was a "blood recruiter" at that time. Waldron was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis around 1966; her daughter, Deborah, has the same disease. Carol Waldron died on March 8, 2007 in Lexington, Massachusetts.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This collection consists primarily of Carol Waldron's diaries, which are extraordinary both in providing an almost-complete, factual life history and in offering rich documentation of Waldron's inner life. Entries are profoundly reflective and analytical, and unflinchingly honest regarding self and others. Among other deeply personal topics, Waldron writes at length about her unhappy marriage and its gradual demise, and about the process of aging. The diaries begin during her teenage years in the 1930's and continue into her 70's. Also included are correspondence, her family tree, a photograph, bible, scrapbook, memrabilia, and legal documents pertaining to Waldron's divorce and to a suit filed by Waldron against the John Hancock Life Insurance Co.</p>
