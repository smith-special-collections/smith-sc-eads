During that time, and since graduating, Pearson has collected the stories of musicians who rose to prominence before the advent of modern web-based tools for documenting their lives and work.

She reflects on the impact of gender and motherhood on her career as a musician and business owner. The interview also covers how living in the South affected the development of her musical career, and the challenge of being a musician with hyperacusis.

               <p>Laura Ballance (b. 1968) is a musician and business owner in Durham, North Carolina. She is the bassist in the rock band Superchunk and co-founder, along with Mac McCaughan, of Merge Records. Superchunk began in 1989, and Merge grew up alongside it as a method to release small-scale recordings by Superchunk and other independent/local acts. In 1992, Merge released their first full-length album, Tossing Seeds by Superchunk, and in 2010, released Arcade Fire's The Suburbs, which won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 2011. By 2012, the label had over 450 releases and had established itself as an indie-rock institution. In the summer of 2013, Ballance announced that she would no longer be touring with Superchunk as a result of her worsening hearing issues. She continues to record with the band and runs Merge.</p>

               <p>In this oral history Nina Gordon and Louise Post discuss their early lives and the fortuitous meeting that led to the formation of Veruca Salt. The interview focuses on their personal experiences within the band, as successful female musicians in the mid to late 1990s, the difficulties that led to their 17-year estrangement, and the events that led to their subsequent reunion.</p>

               <p>Nina Gordon (b. 1967) and Louise Post (b. 1966) are vocalists and guitarists of the rock band, Veruca Salt. Co-founded in 1993, the band reached critical and commercial success in 1994 with the release of their first album American Thighs. The band signed to Geffen Records and gained popularity when the single "Seether" became a hit. After releasing the EP Blow it Out Your Ass, It's Veruca Salt (1996) and a second full-length album, Eight Arms to Hold You (1997), Gordon left the band and embarked on a brief solo career and Post recorded two more albums and an EP under the Veruca Salt moniker. In 2014, the original lineup reunited and toured the United States and Australia. Their first album in 17 years, Ghost Notes, was released in July 2015.</p>
