         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Thomas Dublin was born in Norwalk, Connecticut. His parents, Amos Dublin, a life insurance manager, and Louise Goldschmidt Dublin, a homemaker, raised their family in Westport, CT. He earned his B.A. at Harvard University in 1968 and his Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1977. During this time, his daughters were born, Sascha in 1970 and Sonya in 1974. His dissertation would become his first published book, the pathbreaking <title render="italic">Women at Work: The Transformation of Work and Community in Lowell, Massachusetts, 1826-1860.</title> Dublin would continue to be a leader in the burgeoning field of US women's labor history with the publication of <title render="italic">Farm to Factory: Women's Letters, 1830-1860</title> (1981) and <title render="italic">Transforming Women's Work: New England Lives in the Industrial Revolution</title> (1994). He has also focused on immigration history and ethnic studies as well as more recently published work on the decline of the American coal industry. Dublin taught at the University of California, San Diego from 1977 until 1988 where his courses included US Women's History as well as Urban and Ethnic History. In 1988, he married women's historian Kathryn Kish Sklar and the two then went on to SUNY Binghamton as Distinguished Professors. Together, they founded the Center for the Historical Study of Women and Gender and in 1997 became pioneers in the Digital Humanities when they launched their Web site, <title render="italic">Women and Social Movements</title>. For his contributions to the field, Dublin has received numerous awards and fellowships over the years and, as of 2012, is still teaching an online class for SUNY Binghamton while also having more time in semi-retirement for "hiking and backpacking in the wilderness."</p>
