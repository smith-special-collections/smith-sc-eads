         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Born June 19, 1935 to a Southern Baptist family, Carolyn McDade is a feminist, a writer of women's music, and self-described activist. She studied education at Louisiana Tech, where she received her BA in 1957. Once she married and had three daughters, she had to put music to the wayside. McDade picked it up again in 1970 by beginning a series of recording projects. Her song "Spirit of Life" remains popular in the Unitarian Universalist Church. She later began to lead religious workshops and retreats, including at Womancenter, which she co-founded in Massachusetts in 1983. The center closed in 1991 due to financial difficulties. Her activism in the 1980s included involvement with war tax resistance and the establishment of a refugee sanctuary at the Community Church in Boston. She has also been involved in the Unitarian Universalist Women's Federation, the National Assembly of Religious Women, and the Radical Women's Caucus of Unitarian Universalists.</p>
