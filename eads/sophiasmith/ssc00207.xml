         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Nancy Staver was born in Englewood, New Jersey on 7 July 1913. She earned her B.A. from Mount Holyoke College in 1935 and a MSW from the Smith College School for Social Work in 1943. She worked at the Judge Baker Guidance Center in Boston from 1943-78, beginning there as a social worker and supervisor of trainees, and participating as chief investigator in a long-term research project on learning problems. In 1967, she was appointed Chief of Psychiatric Social Service there. In 1963-64, Staver took a leave of absence from the Judge Baker Guidance Center and performed similar functions at the Tavistock Clinic in London. She served as a research advisor at Smith College School for Social Work from 1954-1965 and again from 1978 through at least 1983. In 1981, Staver returned to the practice of social casework, taking a position at the Learning Center for Deaf Children in Framingham, Massachusetts.
 Staver has written many articles for psychiatric social work journals, mostly related to children's learning problems, and her writings have also been published in books of collected essays.</p>
