         <p>Judith Plaskow was born in Brooklyn, NY to Vivian Ruth Cohen and Jerome M. Plaskow. She earned her B.A. from Clark University in 1968, and her M.Phil. and Ph.D. from Yale University in 1971 and 1975, respectively. She has taught at New York University, Hebrew Union College, Drew Theological School, Douglass College, and Wichita State University. Since 1984 she has been Professor of Religious Studies at Manhattan College in New York.

In addition to cofounding the Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, Plaskow has written and edited several significant books in the field, including one of the first feminist dissertations in religious studies, Sex, Sin, and Grace: Women's Experience and the Theologies of Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich (1980). Plaskow also wrote the first full-length Jewish feminist theology, Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective (1990).
