         <p>Beatrice Simcox Reiner graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1927 and went on to earn a M.S.W. in 1937 from the New York School of Social Work (later affiliated with Columbia University). She worked as a caseworker and supervisor at the Community Service Society in New York from 1931-44 and then at the Family Service Association of Greater Boston (Massachusetts) from 1944-58. She went on to work at the Judge Baker Guidance Center in Boston from 1954-58, where she gathered material for her book, Character Disorders in Parents of Delinquents (1959). From 1961-75, she worked for the Juvenile Welfare Board of Pinellas County, Florida, first as a family counselor and later as a consultant.
 Reiner's career included teaching as well as social casework. She taught at the Simmons College School for Social Work from 1946-47; the Boston University School for Social Work from 1947-48; and at the Hailie Sellassie I University School of Social Work in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 1966-69. Reiner also led many professional workshops and institutes throughout the United States.</p>
