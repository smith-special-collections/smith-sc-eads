         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>The Cherry Family were farmers who lived in Litchfield, Illinois in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. According to family lore, John Dempsey Cherry lied about his age in order to fight for the Union in the Civil War in which his red hair drew sniper fire whenever he raised his head above the ground. He was wounded, returned home and died young.</p>
