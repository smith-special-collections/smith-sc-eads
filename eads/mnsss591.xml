         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Diane (Dee) Mosbacher, MD, PhD, was born in Houston, Texas on January 13, 1949 to Jane
            Pennybacker (1926-1970) and businessman Robert Adam Mosbacher, Sr. (1927-2010). She has
            three siblings, Robert Mosbacher, Jr. (1951-), Kathryn Mosbacher (1953), and Lisa
            Mosbacher Mears (1956-).</p>
         <p>Dee Mosbacher's wife is Nanette Gartrell, M.D., formerly a professor of psychiatry at
            Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Francisco, and, since 2009,
            a Visiting Distinguished Scholar at the Williams Institute, University of California,
            Los Angeles, School of Law. Gartrell is the principal investigator of the U. S. National
            Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study (NLLFS), the largest, longest-running prospective
            investigation of lesbian mothers and their children in the United States. The two have
            been together since 1975 and married in 2004 (annulled by the State of California) and
            2005. Dr. Dee Mosbacher and Dr. Nanette Gartrell live and work in San Francisco.</p>
         <p>Dee Mosbacher received her primary and secondary education at Kinkaid School from which
            she graduated in 1967. She graduated from Pitzer College with a B.A. in psychology in
            1972. She received a doctorate in social psychology from Union Graduate School in 1979
            and a medical degree from Baylor College of Medicine in 1983. She was a medical intern
            at Cambridge Hospital through Harvard Medical School from 1983-1984 and was a psychiatry
            resident in the same hospital from 1984-1987.</p>
         <p>Dee Mosbacher became a women's health activist in college and began directing
            documentary films as a student at Baylor College and as a resident at Harvard Medical
            School. Her films focused on discrimination against lesbian and gay physicians and
            patients, and she wrote many articles about gay and lesbian patients for the academic
            and medical community.</p>
         <p>Dee Mosbacher's father, Robert A. Mosbacher, Sr., was a Texas oil and gas producer, who
            served as a chief fundraiser for five Republican presidential campaigns. Robert, Sr.
            served as Commerce Secretary under President George H. W. Bush but left his post in 1992
            to raise funds for Bush's reelection campaign. The Republican Party intensified their
            anti-gay, anti-abortion rhetoric during this time period, which was a point of
            contention for Robert, Sr. and his daughter Dee, who spoke out against the Republican
            Party's use of homophobia as a fundraising tool in the 1992 election.</p>
         <p>In 1992, Dee Mosbacher founded the non-profit production company Woman Vision to
            counteract the media campaign on LGBT issues conducted by the Republican Party, which
            was the focus of the 1992 Republican National Convention. As a psychiatrist, Mosbacher
            understood the psychological and psychosocial suffering caused by homophobia and created
            Woman Vision to promote equal treatment of all people through the production and use of
            educational media. Woman Vision promotes positive role models and supportive images of
            societally marginalized people. It uses diversity trainings, lectures, and other
            educational outreach programs to encourage people to abandon their homophobia and to
            improve the lives of LGBT individuals. Dr. Mosbacher has directed and produced nine
            documentaries, which have received a total of forty-six awards nationally and
            internationally, including a 1994 Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Short
            Film for Straight From the Heart. This film was screened at a bipartisan event for
            Congress in 1995.</p>
         <p>Dee Mosbacher has been a recipient of numerous awards, including the 1992 National Gay
            and Lesbian Task Force Creating Change Award for "courage and honesty in challenging the
            Republican Party's tactics;" the 1993 NOW Women of Power Award; the 1997 Lambda Liberty
            Award; the 2002 Pitzer College award "for unwavering support of our goal of educating
            students to social responsibility and for being a model in her own life of that goal;"
            the 2009 Barbara Gittings Award; the 2014 John E. Fryer Award from the American
            Psychiatric Association for "contributing to the mental health of sexual minorities;"
            and, as a co-recipient with Dr. Nanette Gartrell, the 2014 Legal Aid Society Mathew O.
            Tobriner Public Service Award.</p>
         <p>In 1991, Dee Mosbacher was the first Pitzer College graduate to deliver a commencement
            address at her alma mater. In 2010, she established the Mosbacher/Gartrell Center for
            Media Experimentation and Activism at Pitzer College.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Dee Mosbacher papers and Woman Vision records document Dee Mosbacher's personal and
            professional life, both within and beyond her film production company, Woman Vision. </p>
         <p>The first series of Mosbacher's personal and professional papers includes a small amount
            of material from her days as a graduate and medical student, and a small amount of
            digitized photographs and other personal historical materials, but mostly documents her
            life and work in the 1980s and 1990s. It includes articles about her, as well as
            materials she authored, speeches she gave, and two films she produced that were directed
            by Joan E. Biren (JEB).</p>
         <p>The bulk of the collection is in the second series, which documents the work of the
            non-profit film production company Dee Mosbacher founded in 1992, Woman Vision. This
            series includes paper files about the funding, production, publicity, and response to
            the films, as well as a significant amount of audiovisual materials such as raw footage
            of interviews and other materials used in the films, early edits of the films, and final
            cuts.</p>
         <p>The films that Woman Vision has produced cover a range of topics, but notable themes
            include issues around homophobia in various social, racial, and religious contexts;
            homophobia in medicine and sports; women's history; and the lived experiences of gay and
            lesbian people, particularly those of color.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The Dee Mosbacher personal and professional papers series contains biographical
                  information about Dee Mosbacher, as well as documentation of her personal life and
                  professional work outside of Woman Vision. </p>
               <p>The earliest materials in this series date from her time as a graduate student in
                  the 1970s, and include an "Original Lammas" T-shirt, a play written under the name
                  "Li Garland," 1977 letters of recommendation following a 1-month clerkship through
                  Harvard Medical School, and a copy of her doctoral dissertation.</p>
               <p>Later materials in the series documenting Dee Mosbacher's career include a 2014
                  copy of her curriculum vitae and copies of her speeches, presentations, and
                  writings, including a recording of her 1991 commencement speech at Pitzer. The
                  series contains two folders of documents related to the U.S. National Longitudinal
                  Lesbian Family Study.</p>
               <p>Of particular note in this series are copies of audiovisual presentations aimed at
                  medical students that were directed by Joan E. Biren (JEB) and produced by Dee
                  Mosbacher prior to the founding of Woman Vision: <emph render="italic">Closets are
                     Health Hazards: Gay and Lesbian Physicians Come Out</emph> (1985) and <emph
                     render="italic">Lesbian Physicians on Practice, Patients and Power</emph>
                  (1991).</p>
               <p>The series also includes numerous writings about Dee Mosbacher, information about
                  awards she received, the text of a "Toast to Dee" at her sixtieth birthday written
                  by her wife Nanette Gartrell, as well as a small number of photographic prints
                  from the early 2000s and digital copies of personal photographs and files from
                  throughout her life.</p>
