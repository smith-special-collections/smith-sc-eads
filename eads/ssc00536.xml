         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Ronnie Gilbert was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Sarah Bekerman, a dressmaker, and Charles Gilbert, a factory worker and (later) owner in the needle trades. She has one sister, born in 1928. Gilbert worked in a U.S. government office as a clerk-typist during World War II. She began singing on radio shows at age twelve, and was a founding member of the folk group, The Weavers (1947). Gilbert was blacklisted during the McCarthy Era, along with the rest of the Weavers, due to her political beliefs, putting her performing career in temporary abeyance. She earned a M.S. degree in clinical psychology from Lone Mountain College in 1974, and practiced psychotherapy for eight years afterwards. Gilbert's career in the performing arts spans over fifty years and includes acting, singing, recording, teaching, and play-writing. In addition to her work with The Weavers, she has recorded albums and performed with Holly Near and Adrienne Torf and has also narrated numerous documentary films. Gilbert is active in feminist and global peace work, and frequently lectures and gives workshops. She has taken a strong role in the work of the Women In Black organization, challenging U.S. policy in the Middle East and around the world.</p>
