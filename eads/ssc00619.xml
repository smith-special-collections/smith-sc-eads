         <p>Diana Lee Beach is a graduate of Smith College (1968) and Berkeley Divinity School (1971), where she was the first and only female student; she holds a Doctor of Ministry degree from the New York Theological Seminary. Beach also studied at the C.G. Jung-Institut in Zurich, Switzerland. She has worked on the national staffs of the Epicopal and Presbyterian churches and the National Council of Churches, and is one of the first women to be ordained a priest in the Episcopal church (1978). She served as Dean of Pastoral Studies at the New York Theological Seminary for ten years, where she taught pastoral theology and depth psychology. During the 1980s and 1990s, she was in private practice in New York City and in her home in Jersey City, New Jersey. Beach was a Priest Associate at Christ Church in Short Hills, New Jersey, and has served as priest-in-charge of several inner city churches. She has also been on the faculty of Interweave, a spirituality center in the Diocese of Newark, New Jersey; the Professional Enrichmnent Program, training psychotherapists in a Jungian perspective; and the Blanton Peale Graduate Institute, training pastoral counselors. She speaks and writes on the subjects of soul work, retirement, the divine feminine, and feminine spirituality. In 2006, Beach moved to Maine to join the core staff of Greenfire Women's Retreat Center.</p>
