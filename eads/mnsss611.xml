         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Linda Burnham is a journalist, activist, and leader in women's rights movements, particularly with organizations and projects serving and advocating for women of color.</p>
         <p>Burnham was born in 1948 to parents who were active in the Young Communist League in the 1930s and 1940s. She grew up in Brooklyn, New York and graduated from Reed College in 1968. As a journalist and political activist, Burnham has been involved with the Venceremos Brigades, the Third World Women's Alliance, the Alliance Against Women's Oppression, the Angela Davis Defense Committee, and the Line of March. She co-founded the Women of Color Resource Center in Oakland, California in 1990 and served as its Executive Director for eighteen years. Burnham is currently the National Research Director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance.
 
In 2009, Burnham edited "Changing the Race: Racial Politics and the Election of Barack Obama." Her recent writings focus on women and poverty and on women and militarism. In 2012, she co-authored "Home Economics: The Invisible and Unregulated World of Domestic Work." Her deep commitment to organizing the oppressed has earned her multiple awards. She was nominated in 2005 as one of the 1000 Peace Women for the Nobel Prize and received the Twink Frey Social Activist Award in 2008. She also practices and has taught yoga for decades and has studied African and African diasporic dance.</p>
