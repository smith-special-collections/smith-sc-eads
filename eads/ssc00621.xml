         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Sophia Alexandra Zaide Emmet West (aka Luna Moon) was born in New York City, the daughter of Olivia Emmet and Anthony West (himself the son and only child of H.G. Wells and Rebecca West). She had a younger brother, Adam, and a half sister, Caroline. The family lived in New York City and Stonington, Connecticut until 1972, when they moved to London. West returned to the U.S. to attend the Putney School in Putney, Vermont, and then enrolled at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. She was recognized at both schools as a gifted student and promising writer. West was a lesbian feminist, pacifist, and political activist, choosing to live in a variety of feminist collectives - in Seneca, New York and, ultimately, in Oakland, California. She suffered from epilepsy due to injuries sustained in a childhood sledding accident, and died in Oakland of a seizure at the age of thirty-four. A book of West's poems, Mouths, Tigers' Mouths: Selected Poems was published posthumously by her mother in 2003.</p>
