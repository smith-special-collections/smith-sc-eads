         <head>Content Description</head>
         <p>The Transnational Adoptee Oral History Project documents the experiences of transnationally and transracially adopted students at Smith College. The project consists of eight oral histories (video recordings and transcripts) conducted during October 2017 by Rebecca York and Leigh Johnston, both members of Smith Class of 2018.  </p>
         <p>These interviews are the first step in building a community of transnational, transracial adoptees at Smith.  The interviews represent a chance to push back on the single-story surrounding traditional narratives of transnational and transracial adoptions, and begin to complicate the themes of "family" and "belonging" that many transnational/transracial adoptees have heard so much growing up. These interviews document a wealth of experience and knowledge that has gone undocumented thus far. </p>

               <p>parents at fourteen months. She grew up in the Twin Cities area in Minnesota before coming to Smith College in the fall of 2015. At Smith, Julia is majoring in Economics with a minor in Ethics. She has been very involved on campus, on the varsity track team for a year, a Residence Life leader in Morris House, and a member of MISC (Multi-ethnic Interracial Smith College). Following graduation, Ing hopes to enter a business related career, specifically in start-ups.</p>

               <p>In this oral history, Julia Ing describes growing up in Minnesota in her interracial, divorced family. Her father is German and her mother is second-generation Chinese-American, and they divorced when she was five. Ing discusses the racial experience of having female-Asian representation in her family growing up, and how it complicated her identity with adoption and influenced her process of coming to better understand race and her relationship with the label "person of color." She also talks about the process of coming out as bisexual during her time at Smith, and how she sees her identity as a Chinese adoptee intersecting with her identity as bisexual. Ing's story provides insight into adoptee narratives of interracial families, understanding adoptees experiences with class and privilege, and seeing how the college experience shapes understanding about race.</p>

               <p>In this interview, Leigh Johnston (b. 1995) talks about her life as a transnational adoptee from China. Johnston is a current senior at Smith College, pursuing a Sociology major. On top of this, Johnston works at Smith College's Office of Admission and is House President of Martha Wilson House. Both at Admissions and in her house, Johnston is working to promote the creation of safe spaces for students of color on campus. Johnston is the co-producer of the Transnational Adoptee Oral History Project. Post-graduation, Johnston is looking forward to a future in advertising.</p>

               <p>This oral history focuses on Johnston's ever-evolving understanding of race and culture as a transnational adoptee. Johnston talks about her childhood spent between Massachusetts and Hawaii, and how she found her way back to Northampton. She discusses the differences in how race is talked about in Hawaii versus Northampton, and how this has shaped her understanding of racial identity. Johnston discusses her work in Smith's Office of Admission, her four-year involvement in Wilson House leadership, and her introduction to the study of Mandarin. Johnston's oral history sheds light on the ways that identity formation for transnational, transracial adoptees differs from that of other people of color born to biological parents.</p>

               <p>Kathryn Maurer (b. 1995) is a transnational adoptee from South Korea. Maurer is a current senior at Smith College, pursuing a Sociology major. Maurer also serves as Gardiner House's President where she focuses on building a safe, accepting community.</p>

               <p>In this oral history, Maurer emphasizes the role of mental health in her experience as a transnational adoptee from South Korea. Maurer's narrative documents not only her experiences with adoption, but also that of her three brothers, also adopted from South Korea. Her interview discusses the unique ways that transracial, transnational adoptees learn about and understand race. Maurer also discusses the importance of mental health awareness both in her personal life and in her role as House President at Smith.  Maurer's oral history illuminates the importance of family, mental health awareness, and the role that Smith played in heightening her consciousness of the role that race and racism plays in shaping the transnational adoptee experience.</p>

               <p>In this oral history, Lily Pearl describes growing up in Southborough, Massachusetts after being adopted from Hefei, China. In Southborough, Pearl was one of the only non-white kids in her community. She talks about the challenges she faced in school with her dyslexia, as a racial minority, and also the only out gay student in her school. At Smith, Pearl has found belonging through various organizations including Rugby, Bridge, and House Council, and talks about her evolution with identifying as a person of color. Pearl's story provides insight into adoptee narratives and how we process the intersections of transnational adoption, transracial families, sexuality, gender, and ability.</p>

               <p>This oral history centers Annina Van Riper's experiences as a transnational, transracial adoptee. The interview begins with discussing Van Riper's life and career at Smith College, including their experiences with the college's unique housing system, and what it's like playing sports at a historically women's college. Van Riper talks about the importance of learning her birth language, and what it was like visiting China and her former orphanage. Van Riper describes her process for coming to terms with her adoption, and the role that competitive sports played in easing these realizations. In this interview, Van Riper also talks about the role that transnational/ transracial adoption has played in shaping her relationships, and how she aims to build connections that center honesty and healing. Van Riper's oral history sheds light on the ways that transnational, transracial adoptees construct their racial identity, and how this formation is complicated when one holds multiple marginalized identities.</p>

               <p>In this oral history, Rebecca York describes growing up in Takoma Park, MD with her parents, after being adopted at one-year-old from an orphanage Kunming, China. Although Takoma Park is primarily white, York discusses the significance of having three best friends growing up, all Chinese adoptees, and how together they navigated growing up in white families and schools. This oral history explores York's experience growing up in a radical household, and how her upbringing influenced York to want to help make the world more socially just through advocacy, organizing, and facilitation. York's story provides insight into adoptee narratives involving queer identity, coming out, and activist spaces for adoptees.</p>
