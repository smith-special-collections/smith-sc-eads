         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Jere Abbott was born in 1897 to Arthur Abbott and Flora Parkman (Abbott) in Dexter, Maine. Abbott received his bachelor's degree from Bowdoin College in science and went on to attend graduate school at Harvard University in physics. It was here that he met Alfred Hamilton Barr, who sparked his interest in Art History. Abbott studied in France and Russia, and returned to the US to receive a graduate degree in art history from Princeton. From 1929-1932, Abbott worked as the first associate director of the Museum of Modern Art, alongside its first director, Barr. In 1932, Abbott became director of the Smith College Museum of Art, where he also taught some classes in modern art. Abbott was instrumental in shifting the Museum's focus toward the collection of modern pieces, including Picasso's cubist Table, Guitar, and Bottle (1919). In 1946, Abbott retired from Smith to return to his family business, Amos Abbott Woolen Manufacturing Company in Dexter, Maine, as treasurer. He died in 1982, at the age of 84, leaving a $4.3-million acquisition fund to the Colby College Museum of Art.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection contains material from both Jere Abbott's time working at Smith, including photographs and announcements of lectures and museum acquisitions, and his time after retirement. A large portion of the collection is the sketches and cartoons that Abbott drew from 1944-1959. There is also a number of personal correspondence, largely holiday letters, written to Mary [B. Mace?] about his life in retirement.</p>
