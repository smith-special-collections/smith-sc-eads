         <p>The Alumnae Oral History Project was funded by the President's Office and the College Archives and coordinated by Kelly Anderson. Students from the Archives Concentration and Anderson's classes in oral history conducted the interviews with alumnae over reunion weekend in May from 2010 to 2017 in the Alumnae Gymnasium, the home of the Smith College Archives. </p>

                  <p>Sally Katzen Dyk begins her interview with a story about being one of the "dirty dozen," a group that the dean admitted to Smith in spite of their low SAT scores, and who went on to be leaders on campus. She discusses her interest in the Civil Rights Movement, which was sparked by seeing the "I Have a Dream" speech and manifested itself in her role in organizing the Southern Student Exchange at Smith. She talks about her experiences with racism when she spent a week at an all-black college in the South. She recalls the assassination of JFK on her birthday as well as her role on campus during 9/11, when she had just returned to Smith as a professor. She considers the differences between the college in the 1960s and in the 2000s. Additionally, she discusses her work in three presidential administrations and the confidence that Smith gave her for her career.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Joan Gass recalls her journey to Smith and her two years here. Feeling like an outsider compared to the "typical" Smithie, she has a different perspective on social life and traditions on campus. She reflects on the political climate at Smith and her own political canvassing she did here. Joan talks about transferring to Brown her sophomore year after marrying her husband, because Smith only allowed single students at the time. She speaks to the sexism she experienced at Smith and at Brown as a married student. Joan ends the interview by remembering how women in her class either married or aimed for more degrees after Smith, because a Smith education did not guarantee a career.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Shaun Hunter talks about being an international student from Canada at Smith and how it shaped her experiences here.

Hunter discusses Smith as a complex intersection of issues and experiences that she continues to reflect on. The interview closes with Hunter's advice for future Smithies.</p>

She also talks about what it was like to study Russian in the Cold War era, as well as what it meant to be a woman in the 1960s. She emphasizes the importance of being open to hearing various points of view so that they can be dealt with in the wider world, and she expresses thankfulness that Smith exposed her to so many different viewpoints and subjects. She concludes by discussing what it feels like to come back for the first reunion she has attended.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Sylvia Lewis discusses her experiences as a member of the class of '74, which had the largest amount of admitted African American students in Smith's history. Lewis discusses her first experience at Smith, a party thrown by Smith's Black Students Alliance to encourage newly admitted Black students to come to Smith. During her time at Smith, Lewis was part of a very active student group who were instrumental in the formation of the African American studies program. Lewis mentions the other contributions of her class, including a Black theater group, the Mwangi Cultural Center, and the Black Alumnae Association.</p>

McNulty speaks to the Smith party scene and the low drinking age, which had a profound effect on issues of sexual violence on campus. She discusses Smith as a feminist school during the 1980s and the desire for students to shape their own experience. She also speaks to the presence of lesbian organizations on campus, sexual experimentation, and a general environment of excitement.</p>

                  <p>Kathie Panfil begins her interview by recalling her time living in Albright and some of the house traditions in which she participated. She talks about the challenges of coming from a less prestigious high school than other Smithies. She discusses the student reactions to George Wallace coming to speak, as well as the overall revision of her political views that she went through while at Smith. Next, she remembers the assassination of JFK. She discusses her experience of the rules and regulations that the college placed on social life. Moving on to academics, Panfil brings up the importance of having enough focus in one's major and the influence of Dean Robinton. Finally, she recalls the expectation that she would get married right after college rather than start a career, and the extent to which she did and did not fulfill this expectation.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Rael discusses her experience coming to Smith from a lower-middle-class Latino family. She describes herself as a feminist from a young age who decided to prioritize her education. Rael describes the experience of living in Cutter House, which was experiencing intense racial tensions within the house community. She recalls the story of watching Salt N' Peppa come to Smith and the opening act being Woody Heralson, who made a racially charged comment on the Rodney King trial. Rael describes feeling depressed and stressed in Cutter House, and eventually moving to Lawrence House for a calmer environment. Towards the end of the interview, Rael continues to come back to the idea of Smith as a hardworking and nurturing environment. Her comments frequently return to nurturing her student-self through challenging times by going on walks and working hard.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, current trustee Agnes Scanlan discusses how Smith being a women's college affected her decision to attend. Scanlan describes the political atmosphere of the late '70s as an extension of the early '70s, with many different student groups on campus advocating for rights and visibility. She talks about growing up in a variety of different places and social cultures and how this prepared her for the multi-cultural environment of Smith. Scanlan also speaks to the perks of attending a women's college, the five-college social scene, and balancing her social life with her academic work. She closes with advice to current Smith students and reflection on her Smith experience.</p>

                  <p>Ja'Milla Lomas begins her interview recounting her accidental introduction to Smith by way of Ruth Simmons, who visited her high school in Houston, Texas. She details her involvement in student government, close relationships with staff and faculty and how her close knit house community was interrupted by a racist incident during her first semester. Lomas explains how the incident affected the remainder of her Smith experience and compares and contrasts this with her Junior Year Away experience at Howard University. She describes the benefits and opportunities afforded her by her Smith network, after college, particularly during the 2007-2008 recession, and credits them with encouraging her to pursue her passion.</p>

                  <p>This interview begins with Ileana Jiménez telling the story of how she came to Smith, her discovery of feminism, and what it was like to be a first generation college student from the Bronx. Jiménez remembers the political climate of the 90s, voting for Bill Clinton, Ellen coming out on TV, and protests led by Nosotras to support migrant farm worker in California. She also describes her involvement at Smith, how she tried to find a place to fit as a Puerto Rican queer woman and landed on student government. Jiménez's work after Smith began with a formative meeting with then Smith College President Ruth Simmons. She has worked the last 20 years teaching English and passing on her feminist teachings from Smith to the next generation of young women.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Mary C Morgan describes the serendipitous nature of her decision to come to Smith. She recalls discussions on Smith as an all-women's college and the formation of the Five College Consortium. Morgan then goes on to talk about her experience moving from an all-women's space to the male-dominated world of legal work. She discusses her work as both a lawyer and a judge and navigating that world as both a woman and a lesbian. The interview concludes with Morgan explaining that she "found that being a visible role model for people had impacts way beyond anything that I ever imagined or even intended. You never know when you drop a pebble in water what's going to happen."</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Amy Ellis Nutt recalls the feminist nature of Smith as a women's college and how
each student brings her own "sense of curiosity and intellectual rigor." She talks about the dating
scene for queer women and the diversity of the Haven house community. Nutt then describes how
Smith laid the groundwork for her future career. She talks about how, though interrupted by mental
illness, her career has blossomed in the journalism world starting with Sports Illustrated and
culminating in a Pulitzer Prize in 2011. The interview concludes with Nutt noting, "the storytelling
that I won that award for began here because you learn how to tell stories in classes … what drives
stories is a sense of mystery and a sense of curiosity and that was, that was the gift that Smith gave
me."</p>

She talks about her favorite professor and her experience defending her honors thesis as well as touching on what it was like being a financially independent student. Payne also recalls her time in both Morrow and Chase House as well as her time abroad in Japan with the Associated Kyoto Program. She talks about the transformative nature of Smith for her saying, "it was very empowering… And I think ultimately it isn't just the Smith education. It's being part of the Smith tradition and community that when you step out into the world, you have this whole institution behind you."</p>

teacher and administrator in all levels of education. She emphasized the importance of community
and focuses on how she can give back to the communities that have supported her.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Gail Van Ekeren talks about her initial challenges coming to Smith and majoring in
Physics. She remembers her house mother and how they would foster a sense of community and
peace within the houses. Van Ekeren also recalls running the Goldwater campaign on campus and
what it was like being Jewish at Smith. After her time at Smith, Van Ekeren explains, she has gone
on to become a Physics teacher in Pennsylvania and was able to reconnect with a Smith professor in
the Physics department through teaching conferences. The interview concludes with Van Ekeren
explaining that she is now back in school taking classes in Anthropology and Archaeology, subjects
she was introduced to by Smith.</p>
