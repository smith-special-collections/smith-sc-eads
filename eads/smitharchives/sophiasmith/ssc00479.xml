         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Joann Aalfs was born in 1923 in St. Paul, MN to Cecelia Elizabeth Nesler and James Humphrey Wilkinson. She attended the Summit School in St. Paul, graduating in 1941, and earned her undergraduate degree at Bennington College in 1945. She attended Union Theological Seminary in New York and in 1950 married John Linden Aalfs, with whom she had four children: Mary Linden (1951), Mark Stephen (1953), Janet Elizabeth (1956), and Thomas John (1958). Beginning in 1951, Aalfs served with her husband in various Presbyterian ministries, including Salem, NY, Kasur, Pakistan, Auburn NY, and Huntsville, TN. She lived in New Bedford, MA from 1962 until 1980, when she escaped what had been an abusive marriage (with the help of Boston College professor, Mary Daly, some of whose classes she had attended) and divorced her husband. Aalfs took refuge at the Battered Women's Shelter in Springfield, Mass. until moving to Northampton, MA (1981); she moved to Wendell, MA in 1989 and then back to Northampton in 1993. She was active in the New Bedford Women's Center in its early days, but in time its focus on activism for women's health, access to abortions, etc., left her unsatisfied. She wanted to be part of a women's community that focused more on consciousness-raising as a tool toward personal and cultural change. Ultimately Aalfs left the NBWC to help found the New Bedford Women's Awareness Group, which met more or less surreptitiously for several years in the 1970s and early 80s in the local YWCA.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The first installment of Joann Aalf's papers contains records and printed materials of the New Bedford Women's Center (founded circa 1969), of which Aalfs was a member. She kept complete and highly detailed records that provide excellent documentation of the beginnings of this grassroots women's organization, the personal and political dimensions of the problems its members sought to address and remedy, as well as the economic, social and cultural context in which it existed. Subsequent accession includes correspondence, newsletters from the New Bedford Women's Center, photographs, scrapbooks, audiocassettes (many of Mary Daly, with transcripts), research materials, and manuscript drafts. Featured organizations/activities include women's martial arts, the Lesbian Empowerment Project, and the New Bedford Women's Awareness Group and Women's Center. Much of the correspondence is family-related, over multiple generations.</p>
