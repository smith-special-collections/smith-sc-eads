         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>The Latina Initiative was created in direct response to the lack of Latina visibility on reproductive rights and health issues. Its mission is to ensure the fundamental human right to reproductive health for Latinas, their families and their communities through education, advocacy and coalition building. NLIRH commenced operations as an independent organization in 1994. Its antecedent, the Latina Initiative, emerged five years earlier under the auspices of Catholics for a Free Choice. After a successful five year track record at Catholics for Free Choice, the Latina Initiative was renamed NLIRH and opened its doors as the first independent national organization and voice for Latinas on health and reproductive rights issues. In 2003 NLIRH re-opened its doors in New York City. To this day, NLIRH is the only national Latina health and reproductive rights organization representing an increasingly diverse and growing Latina population. It's headquarters is located in New York City with their policy office in Washington D.C. Jessica Gonz√°lez-Rojas is the Executive Director.
