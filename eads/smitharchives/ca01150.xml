         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Elsa Siipola was born in 1908 in Fitchburg, MA.  She graduated from Smith in 1929, and continued her education at Smith to receive her M.A.  She received her doctorate from Yale University and returned to Smith as a Professor of Psychology in 1931, where she taught until her retirement in 1974.  Siipola's research centered around the study of personality.  Although many psychologists thought that undergraduates were not yet mature and objective enough to study personality, Siipola pioneered several courses to teach her research to undergraduates.  Siipola also took several administrative positions at Smith: as the Dean of her department, as a member of the Post-War planning committee, as chair of the Alumnae Association's Education Committee, and as an organizer of the Smith College Medal Committee.  For her work, she and her husband were honored by the Trustees in the naming of the Harold Edward and Elsa Siipola Israel Chair of Psychology.  Outside of the college, Siipola lectured at many colleges, including Harvard University and UCLA, was a member of the Governor's Advisory Committee on Service to Youth, and served on the National committee for Undergraduate Science Instruction.  After retirement, Siipola continued to write for psychology journals.  She died in her Northampton home in 1983.</p>
