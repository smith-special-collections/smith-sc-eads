         <p>Born in 1894, Charlotte Baum entered Smith College in 1911. She was involved in a number of student activities including the Cricket Team, Senior Dramatics, and the Yearbook. After graduating in 1915 she studied at the Art Students League in New York City while working as an assistant cataloger for the library and photograph department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As the United States entered World War I, she left the museum to serve as a Reconstruction Aid in federal hospitals. After the war, she returned to libraries and became the cataloger for Columbia University before returning to Smith in 1926 as the Curator of Books and Photographs for the Art Department. Baum retired in 1959 but continued to work various volunteer positions at Cooley Dickinson Hospital until her death in 1989.</p>
