         <p>George Fleck received his B.S. from Yale University in 1956 and a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1961. He was awarded a Danforth Fellowship in 1956 and a DuPont Fellowship in 1959. In 1961, Fleck was hired as Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Smith College where he taught and researched Pyridoxal (a form of vitamin B6) and its reactions with various amino acids and metal ions. He published several articles on the subject, including "Kinetics of the Reaction of Pyridoxal and Alanine" (1961) and his work won him a NIH grant in 1962. His professional affiliations include: American Chemical Society, Sigma Xi and Society for Religion in Higher Education. He was also one of only three trustees for the Meekins library in Williamsburg.</p>
         <p> An ardent supporter of women in science, Fleck researched and published several pieces on the matter including "Mary Lura Sherill" in Women in Chemistry and Physics: A Bibliographic Sourcebook (1993). In 1996 he publically advocated his defense of assistant professor Sharon Palmer and her assertion that she had not attained tenure based upon her gender.</p>
