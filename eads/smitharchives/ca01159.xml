         <p>Carolyn French '49, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George M. French lived in Nashua, New Hampshire, before attending Smith College.  She lived in Comstock House her freshman year and Dawes House her sophomore year.  In 1947, she went to Chambon to attend the College Cévénal, a work camp where she helped build playing fields and barracks and met students from all over Europe.  In her junior year, Carolyn continued to meet with her friends from Chambon while she participated in Smith's Paris Junior Year Abroad program.  Carolyn studied at the Sorbonne, the Louvre, Reid Hall, and the Université de Paris.  During her Junior Year Abroad, Carolyn wrote home about her travels to Italy, Switzerland, and England and about her active social life in Paris attending dances and concerts.  Carolyn returned to Smith and lived in Dawes House for her senior year.  During her time at Smith she was a member of the Lifeguards, the Italian Club, and the College Relief Committee.  
After graduating in 1949, Carolyn attended the Institute of Fine Arts in New York and received her M.A. there in 1952.  She went on to have a career in art history at the Toledo Museum, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Belgian American Foundation in Brussels, and Smith College.  In 1953 she married J. Richard Judson and they had three children, Pieter, Matthew and Sarah.  She reported in her 40th Reunion Book in 1989 that she had retired from High School Special Education teaching in 1982, and spent her time volunteering as an Emergency Room receptionist, a companion to sexual assault victims, a mediator in a Settlement Center dispute, a tutor for LD students, and a delivery worker for Meals on Wheels.</p>
