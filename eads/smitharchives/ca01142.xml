         <p>Margaret Hill Peoples, class of 1920, was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, to John M. and Rebecca (Doty) Peoples in 1896.  After studying for a short time in Switzerland at "les Fougères", Peoples came to Smith College where she would spend most of her working life and where she would earn three degrees: her B.A. in 1920, her M.A. in 1922, and her Ph.D. in 1928.  During her time as a Smith undergraduate, Peoples was very active in college life, as a Junior Usher, a Student Advisor and a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the Silver Bay Delegates, Phi Kappa Psi, La Société Francaise, El Club Espanol, and the Spectator.</p>
         <p>From 1923 until her retirement in 1961, Peoples was a member of the Smith College Department of French.  She focused her academic work on 18th and 19th century literature, specializing in Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo, and George Sand.  For her work on French culture, she was awarded the title of "Officier des Palmes Academiques" by the French government in 1959.  During her work at Smith, Peoples also worked as an administrator.  She was dean of the classes of 1934 and 1942, was chair of her department for several years, and was director of the Junior Year in France.  Upon her retirement, Peoples split her time between her sister's home in Coral Gables, Florida and her Northampton home that she shared with Priscilla Paine Van der Poel, professor emeritus of art.  Peoples died in Coral Gables in 1981 after a long illness.</p>
