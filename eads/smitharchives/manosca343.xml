         <p>Howard Parad was born in 1923 in Boston Massachusetts. Parad graduated from Harvard College magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with an A.B in social science in 1943. In 1947 Parad received a M.S in psychiatric social work from Boston University. He completed a doctorate in social work at Columbia University in 1967. From 1947-1954 Parad was a caseworker and district supervisor at the Family Service Association of Greater Boston. Between the years of 1950 and 1956 Parad was part of the faculty at Boston University School of Social Work, and during his last two years at Boston University Parad was a research associate and instructor in mental health at the Family Guidance Center of the Harvard School of Public Health. In 1956 Parad became the Dean of the Smith College School for Social Work and held this position until 1971. During his time at Smith College Parad did many things including raising enrollment significantly and reevaluating the curriculum. Parad left the School for Social Work to resume teaching, research, and professional practice full time at the University Of Southern California School of Social Work from 1971-1988. During his time as Dean of Smith College Parad also worked as a consultant to the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health 1958-1963 and research project director of Service Association of America and the American Association of Psychiatric Clinics for Children 1965-1968.
