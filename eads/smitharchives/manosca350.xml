         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Marian Hastings Jones was born in Kensington, Connecticut to Horace Kimbal Jones and Ruth Hastings on May 1, 1868. She was raised in Hartford, Connecticut, attending its public schools until she decided to pursue her Bachelor's of Arts at Smith College. She graduated from Smith in 1897, and then went on to receive her Bachelor's of Divinity from Hartford Theological Seminary.</p>
         <p> After graduating from Hartford Theological Seminary, she quickly became pastor of the Staffordville Congregational Church. In doing so she became one of the first women to be ordained into Christian ministry in Connecticut. She transitioned to the First Congregational Church in Canterbury, Connecticut in 1914, serving there for three years. Then Jones became assistant pastor to Dr. Arthur H. Bradfort of the Central Congregational Church in Providence, Rhode Island. She did missionary work with the Portuguese population of Providence for many years. Eventually this culminated in the development of an organized church.</p>
         <p> Jones returned to Canterbury upon retirement. She maintained her involvement in Christian service until her health failed. After years of poor health, Marian Jones died in Canterbury on February 19, 1960.</p>
