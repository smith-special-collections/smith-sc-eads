         <p>
Margaret Ellerbe Mahoney was best known as a philanthropist, executive of many non-profit organizations, civic leader, and trustee of Smith College. The papers primarily document Margaret Mahoney's philanthropic work with the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Commonwealth Fund, UNESCO, and her consulting firm specializing in health care delivery systems, MEM Associates, Inc. The papers also document Margaret Mahoney's personal life, mainly through correspondence.
</p>

         <p>Margaret Ellerbe Mahoney was born in Nashville, Tennessee on October 24, 1924. Her parents, Charles Hallam Mahoney and Leslie Nelson (Nell) Savage Mahoney, had a brief marriage that ended in divorce in May 1925. Leslie Mahoney received full custody of Margaret. Charles Mahoney would later marry a woman named Elizabeth Wood. Charles Mahoney's family did not recognize Margaret's existence, and Margaret had no contact with them until a cousin, Joan Cooper, wrote her, months before Charles's death on August 20, 1988.</p>

         <p>
Margaret's mother, Leslie Mahoney, was an interior design expert and received a Master of Arts in history for her thesis titled "The Building of the Tennessee State House, 1845-1854." Many of Margaret's other relatives worked as doctors at Vanderbilt University. Her maternal grandfather, Dr. Giles C. Savage, and aunt, Dr. Kate Eastman Savage Zerfoss, shared an ophthalmology practice in Nashville, Tennessee, at what was then known as the Savage House. The Savage House was one of only two Nashville townhouses to survive the Civil War and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Dr. Kate Zerfoss advocated for the addition of white lines to the edges of roads as a safety measure.
</p>

         <p>
Margaret Mahoney attended Ward Belmont and West End High School, graduating from the latter in 1942. She attended Vanderbilt University and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in international relations with dual minors in history and art in 1946. Her college years were interrupted by wartime service. She briefly served on a classified assignment with the Army Signal Corps in Arlington, Virginia in 1944. </p>

         <p>
After her graduation from Vanderbilt, she returned to Washington, D.C. area to join the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Relations Staff at the Department of State, arriving in time for the First Session of the General Conference of UNESCO. She began as a clerk-typist and rose to become a program officer for cultural affairs. Her positions at UNESCO sent her traveling to Mexico and Lebanon, among other places. She initiated and organized the International Theatre Institute, the International Association of the Plastic Arts, and the International Music Council.</p>

         <p>
She continued her interest in arts programming after she left UNESCO in 1953 for the Carnegie Corporation in New York City. The Carnegie Corporation introduced her to grant-making, which she continued with for the rest of her professional career. Toward the end of Margaret Mahoney's tenure at Carnegie, she transitioned away from arts-focused philanthropy and instead into the realm of healthcare philanthropy.</p>

         <p>
In 1972, she accepted the position of vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), where she was able to continue working on grants focused on improving quality and access to healthcare. From 1975-1979, during her tenure at RWJF, she was on the faculty of the Princeton University Program in Science and Human Affairs. She taught a course titled "Medicine in Modern America" at Princeton University.</p>

         <p>
In 1980, she moved back to New York City full-time in order to become president of the Commonwealth Fund, making her the first woman to head a major American foundation. She serves as president of the Commonwealth Fund from 1980-1984.</p>

         <p>
Margaret Mahoney founded MEM Associates, Inc., a not-for-profit consulting firm specializing in health care delivery systems. The MEM Associates, inc. organization was headquartered in New York City in 1995. A major initiative of MEM Associates, Inc. was the Healthy Steps for Young Children Program. This program sought to improve the care and education for children ages 0-3. MEM Associates, Inc. also advised other non-profit organizations on developing fundable initiatives to advance the health and well-being of the American public.</p>

         <p>
Margaret Mahoney served on a variety of boards and educational foundations including the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Medical Assistance Advisory Council; the Task Force on Medicaid and Related Programs; the Health Industry Advisory Committee of the Cost of Living Council; the Dermatology Foundation; the Sun Valley Forum on National Health; the National Humanities Center; and the Smith College Board of Trustees (1988-93).</p>

         <p>
Margaret Mahoney received many awards and honors for her professional dedication between 1970 -2011, including numerous honorary degrees and the Lahey Award from the National Fund for Medical Education. After years of failing health, Margaret Mahoney died in New York City on December 22, 2011.

This series is arranged into two sub-series, Personal and Professional.
</p> 

               <p>
The Personal sub-series is arranged into alphabetical, chronological, and subject-specific correspondence. Mahoney's most prolific correspondent was her mother, Leslie Nelson (Nell) Savage Mahoney, whom she often addressed as "Duchess" or "Lady."  Margaret Mahoney also exchanged a substantial amount of correspondence with Thelma Ingles, a healthcare professional, whose papers can be found at Duke University Medical Center Archives, and with Edward Staempfli, a Swiss musical composer and paramour of Mahoney. 
</p>


               <p>
The Professional sub-series is further arranged into General and Outgoing correspondence.  General correspondence dates from 1992-1998 and is arranged alphabetically. Outgoing correspondence dates from 1978-2007 and is arranged chronologically.

This series chronicles Margaret's professional life and is arranged alphabetically by employer name. Margaret's professional journey is illustrated throughout: from government service; her work with the United States War Department in 1944; working to support UNESCO in the State Department; arts funding at Carnegie Corporation; healthcare philanthropy at Carnegie, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), and the Commonwealth Fund; starting her own company, MEM Associates, Inc., at an age when most of her peers retired; and working with Healthy Steps, Inc., on early childhood education in 2005-2007.</p>

               <p>The Employment series also includes lectures and readings taught by Margaret in her Princeton course "Medicine in Modern America," from 1975-1979.</p>

               <p>
Throughout the collection, Margaret Mahoney occasionally wrote notes "to the archives" about her papers and their significance to her. One such note can be found in the Lutheran Medical Center folder of the Employment series. </p>

               <p>This series is divided into two sub-series: Professional and Social.  
</p>

               <p>
The Professional sub-series ranges from 1969-1997 and is arranged alphabetically. It focuses on the numerous philanthropic or non-profit organizations that Mahoney advised, either formally as a member of the board of directors, or informally. The scope of Margaret's official involvements can be found in her résumés in the first folder of Series 1. Biographical material.</p>

               <p>
The Social sub-series is arranged alphabetically. It comprises a much smaller portion of this series and documents the social clubs that Margaret belonged to from 1947-2010. </p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series is divided into four sub-series: Portraits of Margaret Mahoney, Scrapbook photographs, Professional photographs, and Other photographs.</p>

               <p>
The first sub-series, Portraits of Margaret Mahoney, documents professional headshots, in addition to a smaller number of more artistic portraits of Margaret, from 1940-1998.</p>

               <p>
The second sub-series, Scrapbook photographs, ranges from 1940-2007. The photographs were culled from two scrapbooks collected by Margaret. Due to the acidic condition of these scrapbooks, and additionally because photographs were increasingly becoming dislodged from their place in the scrapbook, the photos were removed from their original location. Upon removal, it was difficult to determine the original location of photographs, however the photographs retain their original labels, if any, given by Margaret. In the instance that that it was unclear which labels referred to which photographs, the page was photocopied and placed in with the photographs.</p>

               <p>
The Professional photographs sub-series document events and places from Margaret's professional life, including her UNESCO travels to Mexico and Lebanon in 1947.</p>

               <p>
The Other photographs sub-series contains photographs encountered in the collection, generally housed in envelopes. Quotation marks around the folder title indicate the original label applied by Margaret. These photographs document her childhood, her social life at Vanderbilt, and her travels, among other miscellaneous topics.</p>

               <p>This series consists of two sub-series: Unpublished and Published.</p>

               <p>
Unpublished materials comprise a very small portion of the series and comprise mostly Margaret's diaries from 1935-2003. </p>

               <p>
The Published sub-series consists of speeches, reports, and articles written by Margaret from 1947-2006. This sub-series is arranged chronologically. In several cases, Margaret delivered a speech and subsequently revised it into a published article. In those instances, all related materials have been placed together and are arranged by the earliest iteration of the speech/article.</p>

               <p>
This series provides a good understanding of Margaret's opinions on the contemporary state of philanthropy, healthcare, mentorship, and civic engagement. It includes her research and revisions for the President's Reports in the Commonwealth Fund annual report from 1982-1994.  Of particular interest to scholars of gender and labor is Margaret's speech "Part Time for a Lifetime," delivered at Wellesley in 1981 and subsequently revised and published in Working Woman in 1983.</p>
